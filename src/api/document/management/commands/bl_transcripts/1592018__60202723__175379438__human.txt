D^r. Son:
Cooun of the 11^th I rec'd. & have paid
the Bill you drew upon me for M^r Hunt &
y^r. Quarterly, I cannot forbear acquainting w^th
the pleasure D^r. Barony Lestr gave me, certainly
To sued an Acco^t. of y^r Conduct in the University
such a Character of a son must be alsare
very acceptable to a Parent, whose Attraction
is as great as that I fear you, & which
can never cease whilst you entitle y^r self
so justly to its continuance. I take very
kindly the Instance you have lately given of
Your Acquiesing under what of judge for y^r
Benefit, by y^r reading complying with my
desires of parting with y^r Servant, You may
be sure I would have requir'd it, if I had
not been overy well satisfied how much it will
better y^r Advantage: The Request you make
in his behalf is very reasonable & show a
Principle of good Nature & Justice in you, which
I am exceedingly pleas'd with, & you may
depend upon it, I will take care to reward his
Fidelity to you by getting into some place, w^ch
shall make his sending y^r service easy to
Him, His son is to be with me to morrow
morning, & I propose to send him down to
Oxford some time this Week.
I have rec'd. a Lett^r from Mr. Thomas of
Michael Church a Gentleman of Herefordshire
