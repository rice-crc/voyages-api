M^r. Woodhouse
Yours of the 1. Sail [Sale]: is come safe to Hand
& the report you have made of M^.r Harriots
Estate of Garaway hath given me enough of
it, the very claim of Herriots is further one
to determin me against the thoughtsof_
buying it, tho they allede that the Herriots
the here are only the list of each to be found
upon the premisses, & that they cannot go
elsewhere to seize. As this may happen
in other Case I would be glad to know
what rule you go by in asoitai [illegible] cny [illegible]
the claim & how a purchaser may find
it, what fort of Herriots are due, & how
for the Lord power of Seising reaches.
There will be no Occation for M^.r Lawences
deeds to be fent up to town for a purchase
of no greater value it is hardly worth while
& the Conveyances for it may be drawn &
executed in the Country, the money shall
be ready to be paid assoon as you give
have Notice the hirlings [illegible] are to be sign^d
the report you sent me of the survey
of the estate of Wild: ^N Price in Reily I have
se they agree the building to he too large
bee the Estate & much out of repair, but what
they allege, in that it may be joynd to the
Estate Mr. Ben: Hill rents of me, which they
Say wants, buildings on it. I should be pla^d
to hav y^r thoughts on this points
the sooner I receive y^.r answer concerning
Mr Bowllers Estate the better.
I am glad to hear Mr. Sanders Estate is
