probably demurr upon, and Esteem of too weak Authority to justifi
their acting in Conformity to them in oposition to the positive Cedula
signed by the King of Spain himself
2dly The present Order for New Spain expresly mentions. That
the pd Frederick and her Cargo are to be delivered up, This may admi
