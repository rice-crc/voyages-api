hereof wait on Mr Stanhope with our Compliments & lay before his
Excy this Grievance wch is a Matter of Such a Nature as to render
impracticable the Negro Trade And We dont doubt but his Exy to whom
the Assurances were given upon our former Complaint that no Order
in this Affair should be Sent to the Indies to our prejudice) will equally
resent this proceeding & procure an immediate Order for Redress This is
what We are very Strenuous in, & believe his Excy will be of Opinion
with us, That a Liberty of refreshing Our Negroes in our own Colony
after a long & Sickly Voyage is absolutely necessary & essential to
Our Carrying on the Trade & supplying the Spanish West Indies with
sound & healthy Negroes, as well as the proper Assortments, and that
the refusing this would be very Inhumane & barbarous to them
You will also Observe to his Exy That as We have sent out Several
Ships for the Coast of Africa whose Negroes are to be deliverd at Jamaica
and our Agents there always keep by them a considerable number of
Negroes, a Stop put in this Manner to our introducing them will be
attended with great Loss & Damage to the Company, wherefore a
Moments Time ought not to be lost in putting in a Memorial in the
Strongest Terms, And You may acquaint his Excy That We have
resolved, not to pay one Shilling further on the Several Assignments
made by his Catho Majty out of the Dutys payable by the Compa for
their Negroes, till they see that by the Revocation of this Cedula & that
of the 11 March 1724, they are put into the possession again of their
just Rights & previledges This We are resolvd in & therefore You will
insert it in the Memorial or apprize that Court of it, in such other
Manner as his Excy shall think fit Nor do Wee desire that any
farther steps be taken in procuring the Reservations of the 10 & 5
p Ct for wch We Care not to be at the Charge We proposed till We
See that Wee are more regarded & better secured in our Trade
We defer Answering yr Letters to our Next. But
