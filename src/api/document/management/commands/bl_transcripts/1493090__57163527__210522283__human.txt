Interposition for obtaining Redess of the Infractions and
Grievances complained of We find ourselves under the Necessity
of humbly Representing to Your Majesty That far from having
any Redress of them from the Court of Spain fresh Grievances
have been sence Imposed on the Company
That the Companys Complaint against the appointing
more Spanish Directors in the Indies than are warranted
by the Assiento Treaty to the great delay and Embarrassment
of the Companys Affairs appears to be but too justly grounded
for that by their Behaviour since our said Complaint, they
seem determined to render it impractrcable for us to carry
in the Trade
That the Companys Navigation hath been greatly
Interrupted, by having their Ships Embargoed, one forced into
the Spanish Service, One fired into with Bar Shot from the
Spanish Castle after being regularly cleared, and another
even Chased and Fired at by three Guarda Costas on open Sea
coming out of the same Port with her and knowing her to
belong to the Company
That the Governor of Cuba notwithstanding he is the
Companys Judge Conservator and ought to be Protector of
their Privileges, has been guilty of such Hagrant Acts of
Injustice as to Condemn the Companys Factors to pay for
Spanish Vessels taken by one of your Majestys Skips of War
and other Vessels in which the Company had no concern
Lastly To deprive the Company of having due Satisfaction
