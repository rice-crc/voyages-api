but we have receivd no Letter of the 3 of August, tho yours of the 24 of
that month mentions your then last to be of the 3 Curient, which must
be a mistake, because between the 3 of August & 24t of that month We
padgsurs of the 2d August
On Answer to your Letters I presume you will soon hear
from the Court of Directors, However I can now acquaint you that the
Bills you avvise to have drawn on Mr de Gols have been duely paid
Youll doubtless have heard by our Factors of the leace being
concluded between Great Britain and the rest of the Allies of Hanover
and Spain, which its hoped will be lasting and that Spain will in
future be more favourably attacked to the English Nation than hithert
And that the Company in particular will be enabled to carry on their
Comerce free from the Embarrasments they have hither to met with, and
probably the Spanish officers may now be induced to think they make
a merit in befriending us instead of acting on the contrary Principle
