South Sea will sell now for about 780 PC w^.ch
is a very great Profit, tho I am apt to think it
will still come up higher, but where ever you are
disposed to part w^.th it, I'l speak to Dr. Brydge to
sell it. I wish you had been in Town, for I cant
but think you woud have got by Stocks more than
you will by Hops divers of your Friends have found
the Air of Exacelley agree very well w^th them 
Coz: Wesfaling ,I believe hath made 6 or 7000 pounds
by turning & winding in the Funds, acc^t he began but 
w^.th 100£. I sh^d heartily have rejoyced to have
congratulated you on the same Quickly Occasion
to whom I am very sincerely Sir &c
Humble services from
all here attend your self & Lady
Hoskins & my little Cozens.
