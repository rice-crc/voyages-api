apprizd of the Whole Conduct of Mr Thorowgood and the Factory, That the
Factors were Greatly Blamd for their ill Conduct in the Companys Affairs And
that the Court Greatly Suspected their being entred in to some Combination
The 8th Charge particularly runs in these words vizt
Notwithstanding We gave such positive Orders for selling the
Cargoes either for Money Barter or Trust, in Order to have
full returns by the Elizabeth which was also Orderd to stay
6 Months for the same. And as it appears to us from Mr Thoraigors
Letter from Menico to you that the remaining Part of the Carge
unsold might have been agreed for at soylent upon the Tnvoyse
And 59es for a Pound Sterling to pay a Million pr To down
and the rest in a small time after, By which means if you had
fully followed the Orders, that were given you, we should have
Had the Returns made us; But you having Rejected those prope
Tals, not withstanding his repeated ano pressing Instances and
Mr Paston's having also given his Reasons for the same, you
would not so much as Vouchsafe any of you to go up to Mexico
either to assist at the Compleating some such Advantageous
Agreement But on the Contrary have been the means of losing
what of all things We should most have desired, The Selling the
Cargoe and making the Returns. And that you were frequently
told that the last India Goods by Mason the Manilla Ship
Did not return that year were in Extraordinary Great Domand,
Yet you Insisted on keeping them on pretence that they might help
off some other part of the Cargoe whereby by you gave him lause
to enter his Protest Several times in the Consultation Book,
And this Damage appears the more strongly tous, That tho the
Elizabeth Hayd 4 Months afterwards; Yet you were so far
from Selling the Cargoe in Order to make us beturns; that you
were Obliged to take up 200,000 ps 8/8 at an Interest as we are told
of 10 pent pe Annum Andgieus no Account thereof in you letter
to the Company.
If further appears by the Courts said letter that Capt. Raymond of the
