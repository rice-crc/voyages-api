Gentlemen
Our last was of the 4t October of our Sloop Assients Cap
Uring (Cony inclosed)/ Since which We have receive yours of the 29th June, 17
July 3 & 24t of August, with the Invoices & Bills of Lading inclosd
This goes by the Radelif Capt Barefoot, on which and on
our Snow Sr James, which also now Sails, We have Ship'd the men & Storas
design'd for the sd Frederick and Sloops at Vera Crue as p the Portlidge Bill You
will receive from Mr Whittingham from Gravesend, and the Bills of Lading &
Invoice here Enclosd, We desire you will forward them with all possible
Expedition to Capt Williams by some Ship of Sufficient Burthen Qualifie
with Negroes, Confirmable to the Method We acquainted you in our last We
were put upon by the Court of Spain, But if any Stores have been writ for
and Sent to Vera Cruz from your Island, before these Arrive, you will then be
careful to send only Such of them as will appear to be wanted Consequently
You will be the best Judge of what Burthen the Vessels that carrys these
Stores ought to be, and whether any Sloops of our own will be sufficient, or
that you must hire a ship for the purpose, as We are extreamly Anxious that
no Obstacle may arrise at Vora Crue by such Ships larrying any Goods in
Contravention of the Treaty, Weare Something apprehensive, that the Capt or
Owners of a hired Ship may be tempted To to do, Notwithstanding any care
of yours to prevent it; And therefore We are inclind to think it would be
of service, rather to buy a ship, if you can find a proper one fit to Sail
Emediately, and to put in John Cleland Now in our Service to Comand
her, who is to Sell her as well as can be at Vera Couz;
This We propose only in Case our own Lloops will not be sufficiont,
and upon the Whole We leave it to your Letves, to do the best you can
for the Company either way.
We
