Sir
I have to good an Opinion of ye [the] stock
that I must desire you'l buy in again y^e [the]6000.
You sold for Me Yesterday by w^ch mean there
will be no Occasion for any transferring
& the Difference between the
Price sold & bought at you'l place to my Acc^t.
As soon as I see Cap^t. Cartwright, I will according to
what Sir Matthew Decker has told me is your
desire, speak to him about the 4000. stocks, & if
I find I cannot bring him to reason, rather than
You shall be a sufferer I'l make good y^e difference
to you, when the Notes I gave you shall fall due:
of which I then will take up as much as will pay
that Difference but I desire you'l loose no Time
in buying in again ay sum of 6ooo. Iam &c

Speak in your behalf to those Gentlemen who are
the contracting Parties w^th the Old Proprietor.
