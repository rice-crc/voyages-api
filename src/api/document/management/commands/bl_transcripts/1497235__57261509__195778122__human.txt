by repossessing Onr selves of the Apsiento Trade without any further loss
of time; We now Confirm the directions we gave you in our Letter of the
14 February last with regard to the sending some Negroes to Havana
and Vera Cruz where we have Factors

been Admitted at Carthagena, which we still are of Opinion, notwith

and panama upon the foot of a Comission house instead of
fixt Salarys as heretofore; We have directed them upon their
Arrival at Jamaica, to Consult with you as to the number of

Companys as they Embark on for Portobelo, which you will
take care to do without loss of Time giving the Master the usual
Certificate of her belonging to and being in the Assiento Service, and
the proper dispatches relative to the Negroes, particularly a Certificate
of their not having been in Jamaica above the four Months as

lations and Instructions We have put this Factory under We
herewith transmit you an Extract thereof so far as related
to your house for your Government and if we shall hereafter think
proper to make any Alterations therein, You will be advised thereof
and We doubt not of your giving all the Informations you have
been able to Collect from the papers left with you by Mr. Bleckynden
and others, for enabling the present Factors to recover and get in the
Companys debts and Effects and faclitate their other dependences; We
have received Copy you sent us of the Writing (which Mr Bleckynden
left
