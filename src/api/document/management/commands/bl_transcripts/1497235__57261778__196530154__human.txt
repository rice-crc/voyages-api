with the Assistance of your Judge Conservator (whose power is very
great as appears by the 18 Article of the Assiento) or by any other means
you judge proper You are to Inform us thereof Sending Us Authentick
Testimonys, That We may ground a demand thereupon, for a particular
Cedula for eaptaining this point
24. And whereas We have been credibly Inform'd that great
Numbers of Negroes have been Introduced at Carthagena & otherparts
of the Spanish West Indies, thro the encouragement given by the
Spanish Governors, some of whom have even gone so far: as of their
own pretended Authority to Issue out Licenses for that purpose, &
have also Indulted great Numbers of Negroes illictly Introduced by
others under powers or pretended powers from the King of Spain, You
are to look upon those Introductions and Indultos as illegal & Unjust
and to get the best and most Authentick Informations you can of
them, the better to enable you to make Seizures thereof, and tho you
have power by the Assiento to seize all Negroes which have been Introduced
or Indulted by the Spanish Governors, it may not be prudent to
proceed with that Severity with respect to such Negroes, however
the least satisfaction We can have for the Damages the Compa Sustain
by such Introductions and Indultos, is to have the produce thereof
You must therefore demand the same in Form, and in Case of refusal
to deliver it over to you, Youare to transmit to the Compa Authentick
certificates, of the Numbers so Introduced or Indulted, and ye Amount
of the produce, and in whose hands the same lies, That We may
Remand the necessary Orders for recovering the Money, or for having
it allowed Us at Madrid
25. You are also to make particular Enquiry whether any
and what Negroes have been seized and Confiscated by the Spanish
Governors during the late Supension of the Assiento, and how they
were sold or disposed of and where the produce remains, and make
a legal damand thereof as being the just right and property of the
