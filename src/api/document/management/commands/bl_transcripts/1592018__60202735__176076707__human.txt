Sir
Hart
I am very sorry I was to full of
Busyness when you call'd upon me in y^e Morning
I c.^d not have y.^e satisfaction of speaking w.^th you
to acquaint you w.^th w.^t Discourse I have had w^th
Cap.^t Cartwright upon y^e Subject of the 10^th stock:
He puts that matter in a quite different Light
to what you had done before, & hath given me y^e
enclosed Papers, w.^ch I send you for your perusal
by w.^ch it appears very plain to me, y.^t y.^e 10^t stock
you sold for him cou'd not be ye 10th/110 you bought for
me, since neither the time nor the Price agrees,
the stock for him having been sold ten days before
I gave Orders for the buying for me, & besides was
sold at 177 whereas mine was bought at 185. so y^t
I hope for your own take you'l adjust this affair
w.^th him, in w.^ch I find I have no Concern.
I am &c
General
