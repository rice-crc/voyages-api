Salary I told you should be 60E from account &

to a 100k a year, w^ch is as much as M^r.

Settle the last Lady Day Rondall, tho I
hear He is turn, w^ch I much wonder &

He wnte to Cap^n. Herring to know
where Mr. Hugh [Evans] of [Hanngre] is to be

is to settle with me, not knowing I have [even]
heard of it before neither as to the [Giver] or
The Value. The Sooner you are put in possesion
of M^r. Caleb Powells Estate the better for the mony
