In pursuance of the Reference of the last Court, the Comittee
took into Consideration what number of Negroes will be
proper to be sent to Buenos Ayres, And are of opinion
that a number not exceeding 400 Negroes, to be bought on
the Coast, be Contracted for, and that one Ship be accordingly
taken up for Guinea and Buenos Ayres
The Accountant acquainted the Comittee that Conformble
to their order of the 25 Ultimo, he had revis'd the Tariff
which had been settled for the Factors formerly Choson &
appointed for the Carraccas and otherparts of the
Windward Coast, and had compared it with the Accounts
sent home by Mr Butcher, and that he found the Charges
in Mr Butcher's accounts varied very little from the
Allowances in the said Tariff;
This Comittee are therefore of opinion that the
same Sariff be Confirm'd for the two Factors who are
to reside at the Caraccas
The Comittee also tok into Consideration the Dividing
of the Comission, and are of opinion the same be equally
divided between the said Factors
