Sheweth itself of a red colour is a rock of a kind of Bastard from stone 
mixed with a reasonable good Gemstone  on the soulth east a small wash in
times of Rains; proved some of the sand, but produced nothing, tryed also-
some of the soil ( or rather stone) but in vain; departed thence the same day:
this Hill I named the Redmount. 
At 6 in the morning came unto a long hill and step, its basic lying 
in the river, which hill containeth two Rochs of equal height, about one
Surlong asunder: 15 sathom high, there themselves white and red, in the 
Nothermount 3 (             ) the middlemount, the greatest, handfull wide but not
any ou visille, the stone on the superficies greetishes and bastard from stones
After two sathom a limestone, and two down unto the basic; the top a larse
that full of small trees, but excellent  good walking, and good air, being clear
of underwood; on the side and face of the hill we took up some sand, being \
of colour whiteish  red but proved to solo colour ; to adjudge if nescessary to 
try this hill, but will take up a resonable long time for the effecting there of
besides a small coloney is to be setted therecofr the security of the men whilst 
they work;10 soldiers. and 3 miners will do it, a small fortification being just
cast up. there hills are on the soulth side of the river, 4 by me named the

great Barbados about one mile farther a reasonable way within Land Byeth 
a small hill,by me called middle peak about it a most excellent vally of an 
incomparrable soil, the air nothersome, this very place is very fit for a plantation  
At one a clock in the afternoon anchored the port that goeth up onto 
Baeacienda on the N;side of the river, and hereas also at other places as
we pased up, endeavered for the buying of provisions, but (         ) deipointed

titles or notrade and so had no intelligence of us tll our arrival  for at the 
sonns of Comerce where the grearter likelhood was for the bartering of our 
- convoey of their country , for the sending for the gold mines above in the land 
for the knowledge where the elephants and other beast habits, that so we  
might have greater force berace them of their inheritance and trade and to this 
effect the "               " ( the better to strengthen themselves) mehases along 
up the river to diven places, which sinister pratices brought us much"               "
