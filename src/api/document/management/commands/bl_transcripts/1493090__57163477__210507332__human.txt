On the Reafors ther efedo bi ef of the Copary
appeared so cogent that upon mature deliberation the
said Cedulas of the 26t of March was altered and such New
Clause as proposed for preventing a Remeasurement of the
said Ship under any pretence or Reason whatsoever was
inserted in the New Cadula granted for that Ship the 24 of April
1732 as by the said Cedulas will appear
And accordingly the said Ship producing at Laver Couz
a Certificate of her having been Measured here She was not
Remeasured
And sowell was this Point of Remeasurement unders tood
by Spain to have been settled and their pretension to be
totally dropts, that upon Granting the Ceadulas in 1785 for
the same Ship by the new name of the ariess of Orange
which was before called the Royal Coroline, It was in
the said Cedule expressed, That upon therebeing produced at
Ladera fory a Certificate under the hand of fir Thos Soraldint
that it was the same Ship that went the last Voyage to
that Port by the Name of the Royal Carline, there should
be no remeasurement of the said Ship or its Cargo, but it
should be allowed to be put on shoar there without any
Delay or Embarrassment whatever as was practiced in the
Case of the Royal Caroline, as by the said Cedula dated the
24 April 1735 may appear
These several procedings of Spain in granting there
Cedulas the Company think evidently shew the Spanish Court
had been futty Comined and satisfied of the sumreasonableness
of
