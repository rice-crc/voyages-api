I return you many Thanks for the
last obliging fav.^r w.^ch hath proved of very great
Service to me, & for w.^ch I am under great obligations
to you. I have another Request to make to you in
behalf of a Friend of mine M^r. Shorthop he stands
Candidate to succeed M^r Bland (who is chosen Master
of Eaton School) in the Chaplain's Post to Chelsea College.
My Lord Lincoln is the first Comm.^r & undoubtedly
hath a great Interest in the filling up of this Vaccancy
& as w.^d not trouble his L.^p if I thought he was
otherwise engaged or unwilling to assist this Gentleman
in his Pretensions, I desire you will be so good as to
find out whether his Lord.^sp hath any one else in his
View to befriend on this occasion, that in Case he
hath not I may ask this fav.^r for M^r Shorthop
Your Friend.^sp herein will much oblige
Dear Sir &c
M^r. Freby

It is in behalf of a Friend of mine M^r Shorthop
