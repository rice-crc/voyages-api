will make no difficulty in granting the desired prolongation of the Term
9th Arte And whereas by the 9t Article of the Assiento Contract, The
assientists may Import yearly into the River plate or Buenos Ayres
1200 ps of India, 800 of which are to be disposed of at Buenos Ayres and
the remaining 400 may be carried into and serve for the Provinces above
and Kingdom of Chili, Selling them to the Inhabitants if they will
come to by them in the said Port of Buenos Ayres, And the Assientists
are to hold in the River plate some parcells of Land to be Appointed or
Assigned, pursuant to what was stipulated by the Treaty of Utrecht,
Sufficient to Plant, Cultivate and breed Cattle therein for the Subsis-
-tance of the Negroes, The Company have found by Experience that
that it is Impracticable to Comply with the Letter of this Article as
it now Stands, The Town of Buenos Ayres not being Capable of taking
off above 100 Negroes Annualy, nor is the Restraint put on the other
400 Ps of India in not permitting them to be Sent up into the Pro-
vinces above and kingdom of Chili unless the People will come to
Buenos Ayres to buy them, less pernicious, The Company therefore ha=
=ving represented this to the Court of Spain, his C Majesty was pleased
to grant them a Cedula dated 5 Aug 1725 "Allowing Such of the
"800 Negroes ps of India designd for Buenos Ayres as could not be
"old in that place, to be carried into the Inland Countrys, after waiting
"Six months, and producing Legal proof that they could not be Sold in
"the said Town during that time, and did not take off the Restriction
"of the other 400 ps of India
But this Remedy even as to the 800 Ps of India, being as
bad as the Disease, from the Impracticability of keeping the Negroes
So long, and Especially as his C Majesty has never Assigned the
Lands Stipulated in the River plate, and not having taken off
the aforesaid Restriction as to the other 400 Ps of India, It is there
=fore absolutely Necessary in Order to preserve the Company in the
Enjoyment of this Branch of the Assiento, that the said 9th Article be
Explaind That the Company may have a general Liberty of Sending
Such of the 1200 ps of India into the Countrys, mentioned in
this article, as cannot be Sold in the Town of Buenos Ayres, but
if that cannot be Obtaind, that the time for the Negroes Staying
in the said Port be Shortned from 6 Months to One Month
