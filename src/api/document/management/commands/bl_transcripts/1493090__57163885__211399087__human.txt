South sea House 30th August 1750
Sir
I have just now received your Letter of yeterdays date, and
having revised our account which I transmitted you with my Letter of
the 28th Instant, We find it is a right and true Account, and that the
Papital of New South Sea asnuities as put down in the paper you
now send me, is not the right Capital, You having taken it from the
Act of the 6t of his present Majesty, by which 34th of our then Capital
was converted into New South sea annuches But on such division
We admitting of no Fractions, or any thing less than onepery, in
any Persons account, the several Tractions on that division on
upwards of 12000 Accounts amounted to £8:11:5 1/2 and this
Sum was left to the Companys Capital Trading Stock that so
the several Accounts both of Stock and New Annuities might
stand on the soot of even pence, And that sum is the difference,
as you have noted in your paper, between the Capital of New
South Sea Annuities which you have thereinset down, and the
Capital which we charge it to be And herewith Itransmit You
the like account Isent you the 20 Instant, with the addition only
of the two Capitals of old and New South Sea Armnuches, and drawn in
the Torm that you have sent me And to shew that the several and
Respective Capitals of both Annuities and the Trading Stock amount in
the whole to the sum of £27,302,203:56 mentioned in the First Act
of last Session, there is subjoined to the said Account a NB of what
is the present Capital Trading Stock I am
