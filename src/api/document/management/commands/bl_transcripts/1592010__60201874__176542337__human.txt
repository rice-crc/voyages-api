He may choose whom he pleases, but More thate

and as I am told his friend: yet one of whose
Capacity & Pobily I have a perfect goode
opinion.
I must entreat You'l also let him know
that I have Intellijence [Intelligence] that there are two
Andug one of 10£ p ann the other of 1
p Ann. payable for ever out of his Estate the
first to D. Apperly the other to Mr^s Howell,
which were constantly paid by M^r. Arb. Pye
by Mr. Garge, if this be he hath not acted
candidly by me in not letting me know it
when I took the Mortgage, & I shall expect
that there be an allowance made me for
there, after the rate they usually sell at
Cunte Ahimse Saith there is a considerable
sum Still owing to M^r Frinden over & above
what I formerly paid him, which if time is
another Instance of my not having me twith
that usale from this Gentleman which the friend
they I shewd him O think entitled mne to y
also that then is at farm included in the nento
of a consderable value, which he rath a leawe for
three lives at 10£ pann: thos I am told reckond
O him at 50 or 70, but I presume all there
Matker when we Come to a Closor treaty will
be cleard up to the Satisfaction
