from Spain for the Departure of the South Sea Comps Ship which now Lyvs
Laden We beg Leave to Acquaint you that we are Inform'd the Spaniards
are ffitting out a Flota for vera Cruz, & So Probably the Codula will be
for that Port, Whereas the Companys Ship is Laden with a Cargo fit
only for Carthagona & Porto Belo, which is Altogether Improper for
berafruz And the Goods by Longer lyeing in the Ship will be greatly
Damaged, and it will be Impossible in Point of Time to Provide a
Cargo this Year Proper for vera mrix We therefore Pray that his May
Minister at Madrid may have Instructions to get the fedule accordingly
And Likewise to Obtain a Circular Cedula, to all the Officers in the
Indies to Set the Comps ffactors at Liberty & to Diembargu &
Deliverup to the said ffactors all the Comps Ships Goods & Effects
which have been Seized or Embargd & the Produce of Such as have
been sold & Likewise Crcular Cedulas for Admitting the Comps.
