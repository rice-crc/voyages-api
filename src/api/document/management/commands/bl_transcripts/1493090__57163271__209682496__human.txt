To His Grace the Duke of Newcastle His
Majestys Principal Secretary of State
The humble Memorial of the Court of
Directors of the South sea Company
Represents
That Sir Thomas Geraldino His Catholick
Majestys Director for the affairs of the Assiento has lately
laid before them, a Representation (Copy whereof is hereto
annex'd) containing a Demand on behalf of His Catholick
Majesty for the payment of the Negro Duty in hard Pieces
of Eight, or at the Rate of Four Shillings and sixpence for
each of them, and Signifying that in Case the Company does
not readily agree to so reasonable a Domand His Catholick
Majesty is resolvd to give orders in the West Indies Not to
suffer (in the future) the Introduction of Slaves without first
paying there the Dutys of the full number that the Company
may Import, All which must prove greatly to the prejudice
of this Company, and as the said Court of Directors humbly
apprehend, is contrary to the intent and meaning of the
Assiento and Convention Treatys, as will more fully
appear by their Answer to the said Representation which
Answer is herewith also humbly laid before your Grace
The Court of Diretor do therefore
pray your Grace to lay this Matter
before
