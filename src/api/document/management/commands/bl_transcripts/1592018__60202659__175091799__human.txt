Sir
Philip Jackson hath agreed to
transfer to mr Colico fre the 500 ss s. upon
putting into the Trustees Hands soo £ of the
produce of this stock, wch I have promist
shall be done. I believe the best way nill
be to lay this one in Bank stck bought in
in the Name of the Trusties, & to be
accepted by them in trust for the berefit
of Cp. Younger Children, but in regaid when
this meney was laid out in the s. Sea Co
the Sock was alove 100. theyl expect
that at least as much as ye mony, this
500 L II was bought with, should be secared
in that Manner, & therefore as the SSt. was
then, I think about 125 n produces 625.
theyl be satisfied, if 620 is bought into the
Bank as I have alovementiond, & in such
Care 466 Bank Herk or therealouts nile be
have realy
