to buy no Estates at 40 years purchase
Pray if there is any lodz near you who
understands drawing, will you be so kind to Order
him to take a plan of the ground I have about
Wilton, I mean that part only (& the way to it)
which you commend for to fine a situation for
I have it strongly at my heart to build there, &
if I thought I could come down for 2 days only
& no body know of my being in the Country
should be tempted to give you the trouble of a
Crit. I Remain
