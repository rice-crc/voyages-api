The Assients Treaty, of which we are again to be in
possession by this Agreement allows us to send Skips of Stores
not greater than 150 Sons, so that we must send at least two
Sheps, unless it may be allowed to send one of a larger Burthen, which
is what we would desire you to discourse Marg delatax or Mont
Patino upon, that there may be no difficulty in her Admission We
have no view in this but the Convenience of a less charge to the
Company, And we should think it more Eligible to Spain to
have only one ship dispatch'd for this purpose Difficultys have
formerly arisen about these Storeships, It is necessary that the
Spanish Ministers should Explain themselves in this matter by
giving particular Orders herein, in as much as the Restitution
of the S. Frederick will be of no use to the Company unless we
are Enabled by the Importation of proper & Sufficient stores to
bring her away. We hope they will make no difficulty in granting
our request, and as to the Quantity & Quality of the Stores We shall
for the Satisfaction of the Court of Spain if they require it give
hem an Account We are

Sir,
The Inclosed Draft of the Codula proposd is not that you should get tin
totidem Verbis, but only a Government to you in judging whether the Cedt wher
form'd Comprehends all that We want, tho' I have drawn it pretty near the wsue
Method of Cedulas, the reason tis not done by two Cidules for New Spain & Seruees t
orders which are gone were done, was, because in that Case it depends on the bil
Roy to dispence his orders to the other Ministers before they can restoreany to
which according as he may be of Temper, he may hasten or postpone, whereas bn
sone by one Circular Cidula of which the Comps will sond away ye Duplicates or but
tick Copys to ye places where they have Effects, will operate very quick, So that t
would be very acceptable to the Court, that you could procure the Cdula in the
they have desired, and the sooner it is got to be sent after the others ye better, and
believe half a dozen attested Copys will be sufficient
