for London, But as we have now a View of a Sudden Peace &
you have as we are Inform'd, deposited Some of our Effects in Span
-ards hands in Confidence it may be of good use that some of you
Factory should return back to Carthagona upon the first Notice of
the Governours disposition for admitting you; We therefore direct th
Thompson and Mr Butcher as soon as they can to procede thither and
take the care and Charge of recovering what money may have been so
deposited. In doing which wee need not bell you how necessary it will
be to continue the Same Secrecy and Caution, lest under the Notion of
Such Secretion, and the Cedula for Restitution not being yet Sent yor
you should Expose Such Effects to a risgue, as well as the Persons with
whom you Intrusted the same; As to Mr Burnett and Mr Garthwas
our Orders continue for their coming home, it being necessary we shou
have a full Information of our Affairs before we again op on the Tea
But this is not to be understood as if it proceeded from any dislike n
have to their Conduct. We remain
