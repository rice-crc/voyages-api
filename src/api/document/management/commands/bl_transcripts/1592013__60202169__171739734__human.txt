Barrell of Tockay the best of the Kind I am assur'd ever
came into England, it was consignd to M^r. Wolters (the Kings
agent I think at Rotterdam) by Mr. Schmerling at Vienna
for me; and I wrote to give him Notice of its coming so long
ago as the 15th of October, the Gent. was pleas'd to take
4 Months time to Consider I presume whether it became
him to give me an answer to my Letter, or not and about
a fortnight ago I reced[received] one from him, acquainting me he
had wrote to me in February (which never came to my
hands, and as our Posts are so well regulated, its hardly
ever known a Letter miscarrys I am rather inclin'd to
believe it was never wrote) to advise me of its having been
Ship'd on Board Cap^t. Clark with the Kings Baggage
and consign'd to M^r Samuel Grice at the Customs. This
Gent is the Person who takes the Charge of my Concerns
from abroad at the Customs and such a Vessell being Sent
over for me, I am very Confident he wou'd not have fail'd
to have taken Care of it, and have prevented any Damage
coming to it, I wou'd entreat the Favour of you Sir to
let this Man know what I have wrote, and that I
expect however he sends me over the Bill of Lading
whereby I shall be able to prove upon the Cap^t. that
it was ship'd on Board his Ship in Case it was So
which I confess from the little respect which hath
been shew'd me on this Occasion I question much
whether I was or not Pardon D^r. Sir the trouble I
give you Tockay that is excellent is not to be met
with in this Country, and therefore one wou'd not willing
Â­:ly Suffer it to be lost if it can be recover'd I am ever most
Your &.
faithfully Sir
I Spoke to Count Rothmen to write to him ab^t it
bu t what I can learn he hath shew'd as little Regard
to him as he hath to me.
