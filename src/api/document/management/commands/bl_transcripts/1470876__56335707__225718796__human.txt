carry after the Rate of 50 Negroes at least to 100 Tons
Order'd
That the said Agents be directed to conform
themselves thereto
The Comittee finding the said Agents at Barbados
have drawn on the Company for the Negroes they sent to
the Carraccas at 30 days Sight at 32 P Cent Exchange,
and being inform'd that they Remit their Friends Bills
payable at 3 months and at the same Exchange,
Are of Opinion that the Company ought to have
some Consideration for the difference of Time, and that
the said Agents be acquainted therewith
The Comittee took into Consideration the Memorial of
Messrs Blackwood and Cathcart referr'd by the Court the
4th Instant, praying orders to the Companys Agents at
Jamaica to hire a small Vessel of 50 or 60 Tons at the
Charge of the Memorialists and for their Account to purchase
and Ship on her 25 Negroes to Qualify her to go to
Campeche
And the Comittee finding that no disadvantage to the
Company will arise thereby, but on the contrary a Gain
will accrue by the Indulto of Â£ 60 p Pieza de India
and Sir Thomas Geraldino having no objection
thereto, provided the Vessel carrys the proportion of 50
Negroes to 100 Tons according to her Burthen by the
Register
