Inland, whereas it is Notoriously known to be one of the greatest ports
in the South seas, and the Companys Two Factorys that always hith-
erto resided at Panama, and Portobelo, are by the said Cedula reduced
to one Factory, and restraind to Porto belo only, with leave to send one
or more of those Factors to Panama, and Lima, which is not only
contrary to the 11th Article of the Assiento, which gives the Company leave
to Settle Factorys at all the ports of America without distinction
but is contrary to the practice of all Assientists, and in consistent
with the 10th Article of the Assiento Contract, which has included Pan-
ama by name among the Ports that the Company may make use
of for shipping their Negroes for peru, It is therefore necessary that
the said 11th Article be so Explaind and inforced as to oberate these
Difficultys, notwithstanding any Cedulas to the Contrary
12 Article ... 4 Whereas by the 12th Article of the Assiento leave was
given "upon the Comencement thereof to the Crown of Great Britain
"to send Two ships of War, with their Factors Officers and others, to settle
"their Factorys, as well that they might go with the greater conveniency
"and Security, as that they might provide all things necessary for receiving
"the Vessells that should go with Negroes, which being obliged, (as is there
"in Express'd) to go to take the Blacks in upon the Coast of Africa, and
"thence Transport then to the Ports of the Spanish America, it would be
"incomodious for them to go aboard those ships" Under colour of which
Words tho the design of this Article was for the before mentioned purpose
only of Transporting the Companys Factors, Yet a pretence was made
at Cartagena, that the Company could not Import their Negroes into
the Indies, unless directly from Africa, and So far did that Notion
prevail even at the Court of Madrid, That his CM issued a Cedula
dated 20th Octo 1724 (which was seut to the Indies unknown to the Co.)
forbidding the Importation of any more Negroes from British Colo-
nies, and restraining them to come directly from the Coast of Africa
This Restriction being not only contracy to the practice of all
former Assientists, pacticularly the French, who were allowed by Cedula
from the K of Spain dated 15 Decemr 1706 to Import their Negroes
from Jamaica or Curassao, but also without any real foundation
either in the aforesaid 12th or any other Article of the Assiento Contract
and the Convention of the Year 1716 being very clear on that Point
