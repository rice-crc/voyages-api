Your aroiding the asking the Cedula for these Stores provided you are well
assurd it will be sufficient as you write for the Vice King to know what
has pass'd at Madrid, or to receive Orders thereon from a Minister, to prevent
any Sonbarassment on this Account
As to the other Variance you have made from our Offer to pay
aleavalas upon Selling the Goods when there's no Fair whether in port or
in the Country, you are Cortainly right in suposing our meaning to be as
it really was upon our Enjoyment of Internation as you mention other
wise the Offer would be improper, for no alcavalas are ever paid upon
Selling in the Port of Cora Crur it being a Duty payable upon removen
the goods from the Sort
But as to the Inducement you supose to have had as to make this
Offer, Vizt For letting our Ship 9o when the Flota or Galleons do not, Weha
no notion of that, Our right by the Convention to send out our Ship, Whether
Flota or Galeons go or not being indisputable.
He observe your Opinion is that our offer of paying any dutys
nport may as well be rar'd, unless Something was expressly to be Stipulates
in lieu of them, In Answer to which you will take notice that there are
no Dutys as We know of payable in port Our meaning was as is before
mention'd to pay the Dutys upon Enjoyment of the Internation, whon
there was no fair. But if We can procure the Internation without
paying any aleavalas We should be glad our offer thereof was wared
at least for the present
When We procured the Internation Cidula in 1721 Mr Stratford
wrote us it would certainly take off all pretensions to Alcavalas, and
that Stop'd his further Aplication for freeing the Company from them,
which had he Continued the Court of Spain were then in so good a Disposition
that probably he might have succeeded. But as he advisd us so We
equiesced. And indeed there was some reason to think that as by that
Cedula We had an absolute leave of Iorternating the Goods without any
mention of Aleavalas, it did amount to an Exclusion of them, and
were it otherwise, it would be paying dear for what was given us as
a Grace which is an absurdity
This is all at present I have in Comand to write you,
therefore take my Leave being
Sir,
Your most humb Servt
