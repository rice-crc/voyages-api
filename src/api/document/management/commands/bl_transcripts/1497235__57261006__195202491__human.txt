We have received adce from Capt. Williams dated at Vra fove
the 1st of August Ns advising the arrival there of the Solebay Man ar
with the Orders to the Vice Roy of Mexies, to reestablish the Assints an
nake Restitution psuant to the Preliminarys &c, and that they ha
made a beginning to Comply therewith, having actually delivered
the Ship Sr Frederick, and orderd the snows also to be restored, which
leaves us no room to doubt that the Effects have also since been delire
up, and the Assionts reestablishd again, By this it seems to us That te
Orders were Sincere, And no objection was made thereto; but We cannot
well Conceive, why the Governor of Cartagene, And as We are advised
from Havana, the Governor of that place also, should refuse to Comply
with those Orders, or deny the having received any, unless it be that
they were directed and Dispatch'd only to the two Vice Roys of Pone and
Mexus, neither of which places are dependent on them, Carthagena being
Subject to the Audiencia of St Fee, and the Harana under the imedicte
Jurisdiction of it's Governor, So that for any thing that appears to us
no Orders have been yet Sent to those places, nor for the Coast of Carracas,
which is also under the Comand of St Fee, And this We are the more
indued to suspect from adre which Mr Keene his Majesty's Minister
at Madrid worte us in May Last, by which upon revising Wefind the A

ViceRoy of Sone and Capt General of the several Frovmies of Tune
firme in another, In this Sitution We being under great uncertin
whether the Orders sent are sufficient for all places, and even Suppos
they are, it might be difficult to know whether they are deliverd It bin
in the power of the Vice Roys to deferr the Dispatch of them to the sa
ordinate places, and in that of the Inferior Governors to Conceal ot
the receipt of them, To prevent which Inconveniencys, We are applyn
for me Goneral Circular Cidula to the Vice Roys, Audiencias, Governor
Capt General in the different parts of the Indies for restoring all
Assints Ships, Vessels and Effects, and for Reestablishing the Compe
Comerce, and that such Cidula with a sufficient Number of Duplicates
be put into our own possession to be forwarded by our Selves to the plea
where We have any Concerns, as was done in the year 1721 affer the the
Rupture with Spain, of which We desire you will acquaint our Tach
that are now with you, But in the meantime no opportunity sute
be neglected by our Factors for their admission and obtaining a lene
of the Assunts
And now We are on this Head, Weare further to Acquaint you
