or the Term of the Assiento shall be prolonged untill
it be satisfied
This Article importing a Declaration of his Catho
Majestys Sentiments that according to the Treaty of
Assiento the Term thereby granted is to end in 1744 being
the thirtieth Curent year from the time of its Comencemt
in 1714 according to the Convention in 1716 We think it
incumbent on Us to Observe that by the whole Tenour
of the Treaty of Assiento it appears as we apprehend,
that it was intended the Assientists should have a Term of
thirty years during which they should have the Enjoyment
of all that was stipulated in the said Treaty for their
Benefit In Consideration of which they were on first
Entring on the Trade to advance to his Catholick Majesty
200,000 Dollars (and which was advanced by them
accordingly) not to be repaid until after the end of the
first twenty years of the Assiento, and then to be deducted
by equal Portions during the remaining ten years, out of
the Negro Dutys which they were to pay his Catholick
Majesty in those years, And as they have been thus
Purchasers of Thirty Years Assiento Trade they cannot
but think that they ought to Enjoy the whole Number
of year Contracted for, and that such years wherein the
Trade has been interrupted by unavoidable Accidents not
owing to the Assientissts default should not be reckoned into
the Number, and that this must be the Natural and
equitable Construction of the Treaty We are the further
Confirmed by the Unanimous opinions of three of the most
Leamed
