Yor Letter of the 6th Instant to Mr Ury has been laid
before the Directors of the South Sea Company, and as to that part where you
Signify the deure of the Rt. Honble the Lords Comrs. for Trade & Plantations
to be informed what Proof the Company have that the duty has been demanded
& paid for the Negroes who are only put into Jamaica for Refreshment. I am
comanded to acquaint you for the Information of their Lords that they have
annexd hereto Extracts of Letters on that Subject which they have reces from
their agents on the said Island. And an account of negroes sent from Jamaica
to the Spanish West Indies on account of the assento since the act for laying
the duty took place: As well of those which were bought in the said Island as
those which were imported by the Company intheir own ships tho' only so
many were landed in order to recover them as were sick and the others carried
off in the same ships as well as those Landed & Refresh'd and carried off in the
Sloops of the Country
And as to their Lordps desire to know what objections the Company have
to the paying the duties upon the Exportation of their Negroes bought in that Island
as the Inhabitants there do, The Directors refer their Lords to the reasons
set forth in their Petition and in the Representation of their agents annex thereto
by which may be seen the many advantages arising to the Island from the
Companys ships touching there and refreshing the Negroes and sending them
to the Spanish Ports in their own ships or the Sloops of the Island,
Besides which the Company conceive it to be contrary to the Practice
of all nations where Goods are imported duty free to Burthen em upon their
Reexportation, and they cant but Deem this Duty to be an Infringement
upon
