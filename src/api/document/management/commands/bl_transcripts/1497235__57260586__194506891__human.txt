hereafter arise concerning Matters necessary to be discups'd by them, who
thee they shall be Considered or not, And so the Company be left without
a Remedy. It may be a question whether it may be proper to give
our Answer & defence to the Congress, Or Resorve it till Comissarys shall
be appointed which is what must be Submitted to the Opinion of our
Peempor
Notwithstanding all matters seem to you to more in Ston paces fr
are assured here That all things are Accomodated and Compleatly Settled
on a plen of the Cardinals, and our Ministers are very alert upon it,
But the Terms are what we are not yet sufficiently apprizd of It is
said, but whether with good foundation I know not, That the Compan
Annual Ship is to be yeilded up, If it be so. I shall be much Surprise
at such a Submission without the Companys Srivity or Consent Sure
at least a good Equivalent is secured for our Satisfaction
I have ordered the Secretary to transmit you all the Papers you
write for which will be done by the hands of Mr Smith, Mr Weson
being still much disorderd
You know I have little knowledge of Town Politicks having
but rare Opportunitys of Coffee house Conversation Merchants in
general are known Enemies of the Compad and if not Proprietors, care
little what becomes of their Concerns and would be glad our Annual
Ship were delivered up, But We that are Engaged in their Service ne
not say so, Nor woud it be proper for you to give the Plenipos suc
an Opinion; That is a Subject which however popular on the Gateng
Hfancy Adversary Writers would make very Copious & Clamorou the
Flota & Gallions are certainly to be dispatch'd next year & Supporsen
We are design'd to be protected in all our priviledges agreable to the
Preliminarys Sign'd at the Pardo, If we are kept much longer in
Doubt, on what Conditions and Assurances we are to trade, We shall
be too late to provide the Cargo, And Spain will in that disappoind
ment obtain their desired End, as much for that year, as if the
Dnual Ship was taken away.
I write in too much haste to be correct by I dare say you wi
Collect my Meaning, & Importune the Ministers to be plain with ye
in what is doing or done, relating to the Company's future Trad jut
think they ought not to leave you in the dark
The publick papers that are best Informing shall be sent
on from time to time
I am. Sir your most humbl Servt
