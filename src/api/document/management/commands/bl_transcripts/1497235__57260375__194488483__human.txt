last, which expressly provides for that purpose, but no notice being
taken therein or in the Order for Restitution of our other Ass. Effects
tis not improbable that the said Article may be Construed abroad
tas to exclude those Effects from any provision for Restitution for-
which in our Opinion that Omission will farnish them with too
good an Argument. We are very unwilling to Suppose this to be the
lase either in the Intention or Event however in point of prudence
we think it absolutely necessary that the present Orders should
also explessly provide for their deliver'd up.
This being matter of Great Concern to the Company we could
wish that not only the preliminarys and Explanatory Artucles, but also
the Orders for Restitution had been made more Clear and express, before they
had been sent away, For if the Galleons are to be Suffered to Come home,
before the whole Restitution is Effected or at least an absolute provision
be made for it. We Can depend upon no relief afterwards from the Court of Spain
in that behalf, We have laid a representation on this Subject before the
Duke of Neweastle and desired his Grace's Interposition for obtaining Some
further explanatory Orders, and that we may have Duplicates thereof when
perfected, ir else that we may have a particular fedula for the Delivere
and Restibution of all the Company's Ships Vessell & Effects in General
in the Several and respective ports of the Indies, that have been seizes
wheresoever the same may be, and that Duplicates thereof may be
pansmitted to the Company to be dispatch'd by themselves which is what
was done upon the former peace An 1721 and is what, if the Spaniald
are Sincere and in Earnest, the Cannot, if demanded, refuse, If they
so it will be a plain Evidence of their Sinister Intentions, and may
deserve well to be Considered before the Orders on the part of Brittain
be transmitted to our Squadron in the Indies, For as we observe by
your aforesaid Letter, That the Spanish Orders are to be delivered
and Shewn to Admirel Hobson first, and afterwards to the Spanialdy
at Cauthagena and elsewhere it looks af if the Security of the
Gallions was their chief point in New, and that they would be
at Liberty to do as they please with regard to the Restitutions
to be made on their parts; We are forming the draft of Such a Cidule
