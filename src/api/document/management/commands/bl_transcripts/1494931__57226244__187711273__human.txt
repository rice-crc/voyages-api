We likewise approve yor laying hold of Such Opporturitys
as offer by sending Negroes to the Havana in Northern Vessels, especially
when our own Sloops can be other wise moree advantageously imployd
or when the Returns you shall have been advised of are but small,
seing in their passage home they will as you advise drop Small
Quantitys of Negroes at so moderate a rate as 4 or 6 ps 8/8 p head or
thereabouts, and think it sufficient, when they advise you they want
a good parcel of Negroes & that they have a considerable Remittance
to make to send one of our own Sloops man'd accordingly
As to the Affair of the Dutys on Negroes wth we find has
given You much Trouble, we have nothing to add to what we wrote
You on the 31 Mar last, Save that we have Since laid a Representation
thereof before his Majty which is Still depending. But we hope it

to the last & present Govr & the Orders of Council in that behalf
As to the Dutys wch in the Bills transmitted futher you acquaint
us, are impos'd on foreign Sugars & Indigo towards the support of the
Government of Jamaica We did not think proper to Clog our

in the Island of Cuba, should those fruits be found convenient to be
brought to Jamaica that Trade seeming not practicable to be carried
