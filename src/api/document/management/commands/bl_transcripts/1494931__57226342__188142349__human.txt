the Spaniards seizing their ffects, and making that a pretence for not
accounting with us. We believe he himself cannot but be Sensible, that
neither Mr Woodbridge, nor the Company are lyable thereto, all the
Provision that was made being to Return the Indulto money in Care
of an utter Loss of the Negroes before they were regulated by the Spanish
Oficers, which was not the Case of these Lycensees, their Negroes have
all been regulated and sold before those Seizures happened, neither was
it Intended by those words of an utter loss to Secure against a Wair,
for in that case the Lycensees were to share the Common fate with the
Company, and other his Majestys Subjects, and if Mr Woodbridge or
Mr Bennett have return'd any part of the Indulto money or otherwise made
the Lycensees any allowance on this accot without our Directions it is
what can't be Justifyed, and we do not see they have any Right to
demand Satisfaction of the Company, but rather that they should have
taken the Bennefit of the late Treaty of Peace with Spain, and the
King of Spains Cedula of Restitution grounded thereon, which was
delivered Bennet for that purpose, which they might have found Means
to have sert with the Necessary Instructions by our Sloops from Jamaica
to have put in Execution, and if they have neglected to Apply for that purpose
we ought not to be answerable for the Consequences, However seeing you
write us that this is the most disputable Point, if there be occasion to
prosecute the matter further at Law, we shall as you advise take
Councils opinion here and Transmitt you in order to free Mr Bennet
from Such a Surmise, tho at the same time where it appears to us in
any particular Lysencees Case that they could not have the Efect of
our Lycenses, we may take the Same into Consideration, and make
them such allowances as we find Equitable;
We have reced the Dedimus Potstatem you sent
