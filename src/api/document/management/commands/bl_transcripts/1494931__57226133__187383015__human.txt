We have directed Our Agent to get it explaind after which Weshall Advise
You This Lady is a Particular Friend of the New Vice Roy whom We have alsp
obliged in this Affair
Concerning Seizures of Negroes
Messrs Randal and Bleckynden in a Letter from Portobelo Soon
after ther Arrival advise us That during the suspension of the Assiento the
Royal Officers there seized 80 Negroes which they sold for 16318$ a Certificate
they had sent to Mr Grimes at Panama to Demand the Money We hope You
have taken Care to demand this as well as what other sums may have been taken
by the Spanish Officers for Indultos within that Time and in Case You can
not recover them send Us such Testimonials as are proper for Us, to Make
Our Demand at Madrid You'll also diligently Examine whether any more
Negroes were Seized there, at Panama or elsewhere, And what Negroes thet
have Indulted That the Company may have Justice done them in thee
particulars.
We are glad to hear of Messrs Grimes and Bullers Success in
the Seizure they made at Panama of the 22 Negroes which with some
Staglers made 100 besides 11 at Porto belo, and the Success that attended Messrs
Swartz and Johnson in having seized in a small Time in Panama only and
to Jurisdiction 200 Negroes And the seizure made of the Negroes in the Pirate
Call'd the Cassandra We wish this Method had been continued instead of the
Indulto You afterwards fell into as the One is a Discouragement and the
Others an Incouragement to the private Trade
Weapprove Messrs Swartz and Bleckspedens preventing the
Design it seems the Governor of Porto belo had to Indult these Pyrates Negroes
But as to their Notion that there was a law that the Governor might Discharge
them paying 110 $ P Piece of India We know of no such Law or Practice For as
they were Illicitly Introdued We are undoubtedly entitled to them As to theÂ 
Governour having a power to Discharge them on paying 110 $ p Ps of India
it suems to be a mistake and may arise from their being Ignorant of the aforesaid Rule
