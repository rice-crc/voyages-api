upon their Memorial relating to their Factors non Admission at
Carthagena, for want of orders, as is pretended, from His CM but
as it appears by the asvices receiv'd from those parts that not only
the King of Spain's Original Orders, but the duplicates also had
been delivered to the Governor of that place, the first by the Lieutent
of the Majesties Ship Greypound, which was sent by Comodore
St Loe from Jamarea upon the Arrival of the Soltay Man of War
from Gibraltar, and the other by a Spanish Ship there is room
to suspect some insincuety, and that the pretence for not complyen
with those orders, is only to gain time till the Galleons are come awas
This is what they hope may not be the Case however in this
Situation you will do well to Consider whether there are not grounds
to demand other orders that may be more Effectual, Concerning
which you will douttless perbue such Directions as you have
or may receive thereupon from His Majesties Ministers, Advising
Uts what those orders are We not having applied here for a Cop
of them
We are in expectation of the Cedula for carrying our Stores
by Negro Ships from Jamaca in the manner You proposes, and
it would be a good piece of Service if you could obtain it so as to
extend to Security, without putting us under the necessity of the
precarious Event of asking Cedulas for that purpose
As to the Ceruta for the next Annual Ship You are
desired to take the first favourable opportunity of doing it, which
for the reasons you give there seems no doubt of its being granted
The affair of the Alcavalas and Internation We
Observe your Opinion is to deferr, till a more favourable Juncture
but as to the revoking some Cedulas which stand in the way of
our Trades, and are absolutely necessary to be Revoked, You will
be guided by what Mr Rigby has wrote you thereupon, and
particularly with regard to the Cedulas of 11 March 1723/4
3d of December following and 8 December 1726 as also that
of the 20 October 1724 Forbiding the Introduction of Negroes
from British Colonies, unless you find that the Cedula of the
25 July 1725 which gave us the Liberty of four Months in Jama
is still in Force notwithstanding the Cedula of the 8th of December
1726 which recites it
As.
