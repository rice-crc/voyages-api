Gentlemen
Since our last of the 28 April 1726 wherein we advisd you the then
Situation of Affairs as to Peace or War, We have had no Opportunity of
writing to you. But have Receivd your Sereral Letters up to the 6 March
last with the Spanish and other papers inclosd, and are Sensibly Concern'd
at the hardships you have undergone by means of the Late unjust and
Regorous Reprisalia of which We laid our Complaints before his Majesty
tho was pleas'd most graciously to Assure the Company of his Protection
And hope before this time you have found the Good Effects thereof in the
Restitution of all that was seiz'd. To which End Orders were reciprocally sent
on the part of his Majesty and the King of Spain to our Squadron and
to the Spanish Governors which We hope have been put in Excation
And that our assiento is again Current With this View and the Pros
pect there is of the Congress's coming to a Speedy and happy Cnclusion
We are preparing as fast as We can the men Stores and necessarys, to
bring away the Prince Frederick and the P. of Asturias, which We
are sending to Jamaica to be forwarded from thence to you, by Some
Vessel of sufficient Burthen Qualifying the same with Negroes, that
the stores may appear to Come directly from Jamaica and not from
England
