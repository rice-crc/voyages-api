M^r. Parson
I have just rec^d, both y^r Letters with the Rentalls
& Voucher, w^ch. I have given a usuall to be
examined, & as soon as this is done you shall
have one returned you signed- I approve very
well of what you have done an agree is for
parish taxes with the Tenants, & believeÂ  t'will
prove to my advantage the bee farm, Rest of
20^th: yearly must be paid up & I would have all
arrears of it paid up & the chief rent constant-
ly paid for the future as it grows due. the
Barn you mention of George Hinds to have
been blown down by the great winds. I would
have set up again as soon as May & question
not y^t have in doing it with the best Frugality.
what you write about agreeing with James
Dolynt to prevent his marrying again I like
very well, & devise you'l bring it to a good con=
clusion for tho^ it should serve me a good turn it
would be very well laid out. I doubt then
cannot be good title made to Mr. Stalford's
Etate y^e reason of the Settlement on his
Lady, else I shall be the purchase thereof.
