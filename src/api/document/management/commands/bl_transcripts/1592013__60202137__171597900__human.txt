The enclos'd I have Just receiv'd from
ye Mother and as it Contains a very sad Account
of y^e: little Care Her Nearest Relations take ofher
I thought it proper it should be Communicated
to you that you might prevent by a dutifull Acco^t
of y^r own y^r shame that will otherwise fall
upon you for I have reason to believe she intends
to pition(petition) the King for an Allowance out of y^e Pay
and, I am apt to think a report from the board
of Generall (General) Officers upon it would not be very
favourable either to y^r Charecter (Character) or Fortune.

Yours &c
