Sir,
Beny Keene Esqr
You rill have received a Letter of Thursday last from mr
Smith (Mr Wescomb being then Indisposed) which We order'd him to wite
you, as a Short Acknowledgement of the receipt of your Letter with the
Inclosd Answer of Monsr Patino to your Memorial Convey'd in Marqs dela
Pazs letter of the 12th August concerning our Demand of Store Ships
from England to Vera Cruz, for equiping and bringing away the Ship
Prince Frederick and not being then Capable of giving you a full
Answer or any final directions, Mr Smith was ordered to desire you
to keep on foot the said Demand, and to say that the Directors were
Considering on the Practicability of sending the Necesary Stores by Negro
Vessels from Jamaica And as wee found by Mr Rigbys Letters from Paris, he
intended on this Occasion, to give you, for more Expedition, Some thoughts
of his which he Comunicated to Us, Mr Smith was to desire you by our
Order to have due regard thereto
The Marqs de la Pazâ€™s Letter having been since translated &
Its purport well Considered, We find that the Negroe Vessels are admitted
the right of Carrying Stores, and that they have given no Cause of Jealousy
or uneasiness thereby; and the reasoning of Spain is Enforc'd from hence
to Shew, That there is no necesity for our asking, Nor any imputation of
Denying the means to bring away the Prince Frederick to be Charged
on Spain by their refusing to grant the Permission of Store Ships
directly from England to Vera Cruz For that In Effect Says the Marqs
as to Marriners that may be wanting it will be easy for the Director
to send them from Jamaica to La Vera Cruz, And therefore he Cannot
understand the true reason why the Company should insist so much
in requiring permission for the Mention'd Vessels, when they may fuety
& Send Stores and Sailors to Jamaica, and from thence transport them
to Vera Cruz in Sloops or Vessels belonging to the Company as they
have hitherto practised, without causing at present any Novelty
in the Comerce.
We observe also, That the Marqs Says, His Cath: Majesty
has ordered his Subjects at Havana & Vera Cruz to furnish Such
Stores as may be wanted, at reasonable prises, or even gratis, rather
