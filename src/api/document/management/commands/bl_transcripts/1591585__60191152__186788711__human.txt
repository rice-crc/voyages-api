As I have been Imploy'd in the Hon Company's Service
some years, Whereby I have Acquired a knowledge of the trade in the
Spannish West Indies, particularly from Portovello & Panama to
to Lima &c.
I have ofter Reflected on the Method of its beinge
Carry'd on and would willingly have offerd my Sentiments
thereon some time since, had I had the least Room to think it
would have been kindly Received: but on the Contrary have mett
with hard Usuage for Complying with my Duty.
I Can assue you that the Method this Present Court
of Directors have taken to Carry on the Negro trade, is the Only
method to Destroy it. And that the Company must Infalibly
loose, The Proffitts ariseing from the most Important Factory
they have which is Panama & Portovelle will not Defray the
Usual Expences, something shocking to think that One of
the Best Branches of Trade should be so Neglected, purely Owing
to peeks & Differences
I have taken some pains to Draw out a Calculation
which take the liberty to Inclose you, and should be Glad if
it meets with your Approval viz
1. By this Calculation I Propose the Returns should be made
In 12 months from the Day of Sale
2. The Capital is not avery large Sum for Such a trade
ye Execution is
much to be doubted
as to ye sime of Returns
