or Expedient about the Store Ships, it was by Concert with the Ministry
If there should be a waving of Complaints at the Congress and
a Reference of them to Comissarys We presume it will be on a foot of Assu=
rance that Spain will be in a Disposition to Execute Justice, as it
shall appear by their adjustments
If Spain would yeild any points before such Reference We
should be glad to have
1st A Confirmation of the Cedula of 7th September 1721 admitting
Internation on the foot We mention'd in our last to Mr Keene
of the 29h Ults and freedom from Alcavalas in the Manner
We therein stated it, or a new Cedula for to that Effect, and
revoking all Cedulas repugnant thereto.
2dly Another Cedula admitting the Importation of Negroes from
Jamaica or other British Colonies as the Company have always
practisd, and revoking all Cedulas repugnant thereto
3dly The admission of the Annual Ship of 650 Tons for the
future, for which We have given Reasons in our aforesaid
Ire to Keene and
4thly Which is worth all the rest, The King of Spain to agree
to such Explanations of disputed Articles in the Treaty, as
the British and Spanish Plenipos shall fix to be ratifys
by each Crown. That We may not any more be harass'd with
Arbitrary Interpretations and Private Cedulas
Upon this Subject a Memorial was this day laid before His
Grace the Duke of Newcastle Setting forth that as these are points
absolutely necessary to be explain'd before the Compa can recomence
their Trade, and of too much Consequence to be left at an uncortaint
pending any reference of their other Concerns to Comissarys, His Grace
was intreated that his Majesty's Plenipotentiarys at the Congress
may be instructed thereupon before they submit to the Reforence
This is all at present I have in Comand to acquaint you
with I remain

Your most humble Servt
