that Month directed to all his CM Ministers in the Indies
ordering them not to admit the Importation of any more Negroes
from Our Colonys, but restraining them to come directly from the
Coast of Africa; This Cedula does not seem to be the same You had
procured (and which for the reasons aforesaid, We disliked) but it is
really worse, in as much as it amounts to an absolute prohibition
of our importing Negroes from any British Colonys, and is so
pressing a Grievance that without immediate Redress, it is imprac-
ticable to carry on the Negro Trade, therebeing a Necessity to land
& refresh the Negroes & pick out Such as are unfit to proced to the
Spanish West Indies after so long a Voyage as from the Coast of
Africa, and is undoubtedly for the real Advantage of the Spaniards
be their pretence what it will. As to their Notion on which We
are informed, this Cedula is founded That the Negroes by being
brought into British Colonys are tainted with Heresy whereby
the Priests find great Difficulty in Converting them to the Roman
Catholick Religion; it Seems so risiculous that it deserves no
Answer And We believe Conversion to be least in their thoughts, And
were there any Solidity in the Argument, that removing the
Natives of Africa from one Vessel to another or giving them a few
Days Refreshment would instill hereticall principles into them,
Much Stronger for that purpose would the Argument be, where
the Negroes are clandestinely introduced (which would be the Case
if the Comp did not import them such being generally a Mixture
pickd up wherever they can be met with or such as have been born or
lived in the British Colonies. But 'tis to little purpose to use Arguments,
of it be determined that We shall be embarrassd in every Instance. What we
insist on is a Matter of Right, & as the 12th Art of the Assiento has put
us under no restraint in this particular & the Convention of the Year 1716
is clear in Our favour, and all former Assientists have enjoyd this Liberty
the Cedula We now Complain of is an Innovation & a Notorious Abuse
not to be Submitted to You will therefore imediately upon Receipt
hereof
