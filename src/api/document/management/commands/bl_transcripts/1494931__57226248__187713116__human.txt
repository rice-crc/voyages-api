and conclude he has done it likewise for the others he sold, we dont
apprehend what he means by it; For as by the Treatys our Dutys
are payable at Madrid and not in the Indies and Negroes introduced
this Way are and always have been deemed as if introdued imediately
by the Compa. and are considere as part of the Negroes we are obliged
aunually to furnish So the Dutys for the Licensed Negroes are to be paid
by us at Madrid in like Manner as for the rest & without Distinction
and as we pay the Dutys for the whole Number Stipulated, tho we do
not import so many. So in Case any Dutys have been paid in the
Indies It is an Injury to the Compa. it being a double payment
and if in this Case it has been done You will take Care to send us the
Certificates or Receipts for ye Dutys So paid that we may deduct the sams
out of the next Dutys we are to pay at Madrid, & the like you will
do with respect to the rest of Capt Collets Negs In Case he has paid the
Dutys And as we dont find how these Dutys came to be demanded of
him, or why he should pay them, or whether he apprehend he
himself was to bear that Charge, over & above his Indulto Money
we desire you will inform us
In the mean Tine we admit that the same Indulto for
all places alike Seems unequitable, if it be so that in different places
Negroes sell generally at diffirent prices. And as You apprehend a
Recessity of lowering the Terms at some places You will consider whether
they might not be advanced at others. As for Instance at St. Domingo
& porto Rico You propose the Indult to be reduced to 50 $ P ps of Inda
Might it not be advanced to 100 ps 8/8 We mean without Liberty of
carying Fruits, at Caracas or other parts not so far to Windward
