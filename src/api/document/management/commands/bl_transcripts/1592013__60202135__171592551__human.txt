Told me Sir that there were three Accountants and five Clerks
I presume it cannot be taken amiss, if now the Commission is ended
I desire their Acceptance of a small Present as a token of my Sense
of the trouble I have given them, and of my Inclination to give them
better Proofs of it whenever it shall fall in my Power to serve
them, I send you therefore enclosed a Note on M^r Gray for as
much as will furnish a Sum of fifty pounds a piece to each
of the Accomptants, and thirty pounds to each of the five
Clerks, I'me told there is a Door: Keeper, and House Keeper
and Messenger, amongst them, you will please to distribute
fifty Guineas in such manner as you shall Judge
Proper, I also beg your own Acceptance of an hundred
Guineas, a Present much Short of the favours you have
Bestow'd upon me, but whilst I was thinking of others I
cou'd (could) not but give this little Instance of your being always
Sir,
in my thoughts. I am
Yours &

Sir,
My Friend Major Crosbie before he went out
of Town desir'd me to recommend him to your Favour
and Protection, which from the long Acquaintance that
hath been between us, I cou'd not but very readily comply with
I hope he behaves himself so in the Discharge of his Office as
to merit your Countenance, if he is failing in any part of it
I shall be oblidged to you if you'll let me know it, that Imay
Caution him for the Future being PSwaded (Persuaded) no Errors he
may happen to fall into proceed from his Will which I am Confident
disposes him to nothing so much as to gain your Esteem and
Patronage which if you'll Please to bestow upon him will much
add to the Civilities you have on many occasions shewn (shown) to Sir
Yours &

Sir
I take the Liberty of enclosing to you M^r. Adderly's
Acco^t. which mentions the Ballance of 639.1. which I was saying
when I had the Honour to See you I thought had been paid by
him to you I shall be glad if it is a Mistake to be set right in
it
