Mr Ury

approve of your Conduct in Executing Our Orders, and Particularly that of
taking on shore the Silver belonging to the most pressing Persons, and
keeping it under your key and their Seals, till our further pleasure is

We have taken the Matter into Consideration, and are come to a
Resolution. That all the Silver and Gold (if any) as well belonging to the
Company as private persons be forthwith Landed and brot up with a
sufficient Guard and Lodged in the Company's house till the Company have
opportunity to enquire into the true Proprietors of it, and then what
shall appear to be the Real property of Private persons and no ways belonging
to the Company or their agents will be delivered to such Proprietors.
And lest the Cast. should make any Diffculty of delivering the
said Treasure without having up his bills of Lading. We have writ to
him that this Co will Indemnify him, copy of our Letter to him, you
have herewith.
We beleieve the best way to have a Guard, will be to Speak to the
Govern of Portsmonth for a Guard of his Majestys Troops, and of Capt.
Vincent thinks fit, he may sand some of his Officers or Ships Company up
with the Treasure. But We would have it all delivered to you as the Co
officer.
If you find any Difficilty in any thing you may advice with mr
Ridge, Mr Blakely & Mr Mellish or any of them who are able to a dvise
and assist you, But you are not so to Interess them in this Affair acto give
them any pretence to Comission on the Gold or Silver
We would have you come up with the Treasure, and leave such
Waiters as you think fit on board the ship to come up with her under
the direction of Mr Cleeve who brings this to you
