to you in answer to your former came safe to
y^r hand. I am sorry it's not in my power
to comply with the request you make of getting
you a subscription in the South Sea Company
having Seen by experience in this last which
was taken that my Interest with the Directors

you may apply to having a true Sence of y^r.
misfortures & heartily wishing you a speedy
I am Sr &c
deliverance from them.
