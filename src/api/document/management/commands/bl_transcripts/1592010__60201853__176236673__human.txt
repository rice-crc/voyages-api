Dr. Cap^t.
I have rec'd Yours of the 3^d but have not or
yet had desire to look over the particularÂ 
of the Rentalls, so that I am not able to
say any thing at present to them the occation
of my writing now is chiefely to acquaint you
with a piece of News I have met with but w^ch
I suppose cannot be true viz that Mr. Brown
& his Son plan for some time been making
Interest for Mr. Hills a Conncellor, to be Member
of Parliam^t for [Ons?] Castle, & that they have fix'd
it so well, as to have reciev'd it for him, in so
Much that the Contest will be between me & Mr
Mason: as lis impossible such an affair as this
should have been carryed on so far is so populor
a place nithout coming to y^r knowlede, I take it
for granted it must be a Mistake, however I
would have you enquire into it & let me know
whither there is any Coundalror for the repone
If the sinishing the New house- Gardens &
barn can b done for 200h or then abouts I shall
be nilling to be at that expence, but should be
willing to have it flnight as soon as may be that
I may not be perpetually plageed with Such-
lorse Bills & repairs & libding.
Mr. White used me very ill in the affair, of
the oxen hesever you may continue to employ
him for Galkilute it more to he want of can
& villisence than honeits of which. I hav had by her
Regligence in Seising for the Hernots Sufficient
I am
yr
Expererce.
