I have the fav^r. of y^rs of the 9th
Glozester
Jnst. & return you my humble Thanks for the
Instance you give Me of y^r Friend^p, in being
willing to promote the interest I sh'd. recomend for the
Choice of a Representative for y^r County: but as I
have but a small Concern in Glocestershire & no
ways acquainted w^th any of the Candidates, I think it
will be more prudent for Me not to concern my self
at all w^th it tho^u [though] my Obligations to you for your
Obliging Offer is w^t [what]. I shall always acknowledge w^th
great Thankfullness; & w^ch when a New Parl is
call'd I may perhaps accept of for a Friend of mine
at Tewkesbury, if my Cozen Bridges shall have
no Thoughts of standing Himself, nor of bringing in
any One of his own Acquaintance. I unst [understand] according
to your desire to M^r. Townsend I have rec'd a very
Satisfactory Answer from Him, by w^ch I find you
are very well w^th him & indeed I believe you may
depend upon his Friend^sh; as I do assure You, You can
at all times upon that of
Sir &
