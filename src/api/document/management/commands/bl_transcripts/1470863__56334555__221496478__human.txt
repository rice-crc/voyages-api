he was lately come from the West Indies That he was formerly
concernd in the Lycence Trade on the Coast of Carraceas, under
Powers from Mr Woodbridge the Companys late Agent at Bar=
:badoes; That the Accounts between him and the Company were
Still open, and unadjusted, which he desired might be closed, and
that as he was a Debtor to the Company for Indulto money, he
was willing to make all the Satisfaction he was able, in which
he hoped the Company would be easy with him, in Consideration
of the great Losses he had sustaind by the first Reprisalia, and
other Violences comitted by the Spaniards in breach of the Assiento
Contract, which had almost ruined him, and had hitherto disabled
him from adjusting his Accounts.
He also recomended himself to Serve the Company, in
any Station at home or abroad which he hoped his being Master of
the Spanish Language, and long Experience in Business in the
Spanish West Indies, had qualifyed him for; and assured them of
a faithfull discharge of whotever should be reposed in him.
