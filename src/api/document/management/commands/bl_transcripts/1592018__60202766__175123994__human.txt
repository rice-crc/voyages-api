Mr. Ram
to mention
You are pleased some disputes at Hereford in
relation to the Charity, I have not heard of any that
have happend, but must own considering that I am
the greatest Subscriber to it, I cannot but think, I
might reasonably have expected that the Managers
should sometimes send me a state of their proceeding
that I might know what number of poon have
been provided for, what tradesmen are employ'd, & the
reasons why any of those who were so once have
been dismist & others made use of in their rooms,
but they have not thought fitting to comunicate
any part of this to me not in space of ten years.
I shall be glad to know who the Persons are that
are chose to be the Managers & whether they have
not a Secretary who keeps the Minutes of thei
proceedings if there is, it would be no very burthen=
=some task; for him to send me once a year a Copy
of what is taken down. but I ought to ask your
pardon for giving you this trouble which I hope I
shall the more easily receive, Since it proceeds from
one, who is most incerely
