I could never have recd Your Commands at a more
unfortunate juniture than thy, my Concerny being so entangld
in the publick Funds that tis with the ulmost difficulty, I
raise the mony necessary for the frequent Calls & payment
which the Subscriptions require at the opening of the Books
I shall be little more easy and my attain better settle, if
I can then be serviceable to you, I shall very readily
comply with your Desire, since I entreat you to beleive I
have a very sincere valu & Respect for ye Character wth
will always encline me to approve my self

Your favour of the 1th came sase to my hands, and I
believe you are vory secure in keeping the S. S.S. a little longer
if youl leave it to me to dispose of when I think it proper
Il do the same for you that I will by my self & make no
doubt but to be able to sell it before the opening of the Books
at ₤1100. I like very well ye thoughts of calling in your
₤1500 & thereby ducharging my Nephew Leigh of the obliga
tion he lyes under equaly with his Cather for the security
of it, you may vary justly tell him, as this time of the day,
