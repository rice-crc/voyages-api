to the Company And the Treatys which were founded on great &
National Considerations should not give way to any private Regula
tions of his CM in his Comerce. However if a total Abolition
of the se dutys cannot be obtained, or if you cannot get the liberty
of Internating the Goods without giving up the point of Alcavatar
We must say as Weded in our Letter to you of the 29 August last
and to which We referr That as the Spanish Words of the Treat
may indeed bear a Construction that the Goods shall be sold free
of Dutys in the Ports only & during the time of the Fair & consequently
if they are sold in the Inland Country or where there is no fair, that
in those Cases dutys are to be paid: If that Construction shd prevail
the Company would be Content to pay Alcavalas in case they sh
remove their Goods into the Country to any place from y Fair,
or should their Annual Ship be in any Port when no Flotaor
Galleons are expected But if they are arrived and the Fair be
not held in Port, there is a necessity that the Companys Goods (as
those of the Flotistag always are should be carried to the place where
it is to be held, and being sold there at the time & place of ye Fair
tho not in Port, the Exemption from dutys is equally within the
Just Construction of the Article, And therefore under such restriction
so qualified Weshould make no further dispute about the Matter
of Dutys But then care must be taken that the way and manner
of Competing and Paying this duty be the same in all respects as is
practised with respect to the Flotistas, For otherwise our Goods
will be liable to be unpacked and strictly Valued, which will be
attended with great Inconveniencys, as loss of Time Thefts & co
We hope you will be able to Write by the Flota that
there is a good understanding Establishd between the two Crowns &
their Subjects, which with the account of the distribution of the
Effects of the Galleons may have a good fffeet in New Spain & other
parts, and it would be very lucky if you could get the Gont Circular
Cedule for Restitution ready to send by the same Convoyance, For
We apprehend without Iresh orders nothing will restored, not
