I trouble you with the
enclos'd & heartily with you a good voyage.
& a speedy & happy return. if you meet with
a handsome newfashion'd Snuff boy you'l oblige
me, if you'l bring one over, I would not have it
a very heavy one which is cumbersome in the
pockett. My humble service to M^r. Drummond
& M^r. Arbathnor of Rowen if you see him
Adieu.

I have rec'd yours together with the
Bill enclos'd on M^r. Turner for £147.14. & have
given the Rental you sent up to be examin'd,
I find upon running it over, an Article charg'd of
£11.14.a for the Years Rent to the D: of
Bolton & in the preceeding Rental there is
a like Charge of L12.0.9 surely these could
not two half years together, be paid a whole
years. Rent to the Lord, nor do I conceive how
the sum w^ch is ascertain'd can come to vary. I desire
for the future you'l express for what years the
payment is made & the same in the Taxes for
what Quarters they are.
I observe Lavertium Arrean enercares &
notwithstanding the orders I gave concerning it
last half year, there is as Amendment, pray
let him knew, tis what I will not Satten, & if my
Rents are not paid me. I cannot pay the Tradesmen
