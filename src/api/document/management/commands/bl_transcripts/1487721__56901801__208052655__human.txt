Heartsease (late in the Companys Service) & can give Some Acct of
Ill Practies Committed agt the Company on the Coast of Guinea in the
Negro Trade But is now Imprest on board His Majr Ship the
Monk in the Downs, I am Orderd by the Court to acquaint you therewth
And to Desire that you will Examin & get the best Information you
can from him, as to what he writes upon And if upon any perticular
or General Discovery he may make you see fit to get him Dischargd
from the said Ship, they desire you will do it in order to give him
Liberty to come & make out his Allegations, And you may at the Comps
