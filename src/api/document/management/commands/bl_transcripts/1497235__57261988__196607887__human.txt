South Sea House London 20 Novemr. 1729
Sir,
We reced your letter of the to Inst Mr by the Eapress which
brought the Treaty of Peace, and observe that ours of the 3d past was not
got to your hands, but we doubt not your having it long before this can reach
you, As that Letter containd our Sentiments with regard to the Carta Orden
Annual Ship, and some other particulars of Importance to be imediately
Dispatchd, We have only to add here, that We have called the Ship
The Prince William, and have appointed Capt Willm Clelands Comands
We entirely approve your procuring the necessary Instructions for her
Measurement here, and as her Built is calculated to come withi
the 650 Tons of Permission, We shall after the measurement is over
transmit you the proper Vouchers and Certificates thereof, and desire you
will take care that the Cedula be so worded as to exclude all fture
measurements either of Ship or Cargo in the Indies, upon proof of
the Bentity of the Ship, which we hope will meet wth no difficulty
it being agreeable to a Resolution made by his CM in this behalf
among several others in the year 1725 which were transmitted hither
by Mr Stanhope then at Madred somefew of which were afterwards
turned into fedulas, tho the others were prevented by the misunder
standings that afterwards ensued But as the Peace is now happily
Establish'd, We hope we shall find the good Offects of it by a
favourable and Speedy Oetormination of our Depondencies at the
Court of Madrid, And that in future Weshall enjoy the Trade in
its full Extent free from the Embarrasments We have been obliged
so often to Complain of
This I write by order of the Court of Directors, and am
Sir, Your most humble servant
D. Wescomb
