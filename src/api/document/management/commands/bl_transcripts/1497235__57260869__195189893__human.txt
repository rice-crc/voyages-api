England Having on our Application at Madrid, for the Admission of a Store
ship from England to Vera Cruz, been refus'd, and are by that Court put upon
this Method of sending them Via Jamaica on Negroe Vessels, which pro
hae Vice we have acquised in, rather than at this Juncture, dispute
our Right to Store ships
The Court of Spain give this Reason for refusing the desired Store Ships
from England that the Apprehension of her Carrying out Morchandize
will discourage the Merchants from loading on the Flota next year, which
however absurd they Cannot be satisfied of the Contrary As their see-
lousies of Contraventions to the Treaty are great We have given onr
Agents in Jamaica in Charge to be particularly carefull that nod
goods or Merchandize or any thing but the Companys Stores be put
on board the ship that shall carry them
We hope and are assurd the Orders for the Restitution and opening
the Trade (of which Inclos'd are lopys) will be of sufficent authority with
the Spanith Officers for admitting the men Stores &c without which the
Soince Frederick could not come home and consequently that part
the Preliminary Articles (of which inclosd is also Copy) would be un
comply'd with on the part of Spain: We hope no difficulty will and
in recovering all our Effects and persuade our Selves you do not wan
Stirring up to make all possible dispatch
We Remain your affectionate Friends
