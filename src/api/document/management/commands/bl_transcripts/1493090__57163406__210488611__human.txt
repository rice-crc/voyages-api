As to the first point, the Company must wholly rely on
the 2d Article of the Assients Tenty whereby tis expressly Shpulated
by Spain that his Catholick Majesty is to have the Naming
two directors in the Indies This they conceive evidently limits
the number to two, nor was there ever any attempt to add to
That number till within these few Years and therefore that
Number cannot consistently with the said Treaty (as the
Company insist) be enlarged to Six or Seven under pretence
of the necessity of the Spanish directors being concerned in
all the Affairs of the Company in the Spanish West Indies
and the Company cannot but observe the Weakness of
M Patinos Reasoning on this Coint for that it is first
taken for granted that the two Directors may appoint as
many deputies as they shall think necessary to reside at
such places where themselves cannot be present (which liberty
of appointing Deputies no where appears in the Teaty and
then this is laid as a Poundation for his Catholick Majestys
appointing as many Directrs as he thinks fitt, The
appointing therefore somany Spanish directors in the West
Indies, and this nowise warranted by the Words of the Treaty
cannot as we apprehend but be esteemed a great Grivance,
especially as it has been attendes with the putting
Constant Hardships upon the Company in the Transaction
of their Affairs in the Spanish West Indies, Which
leads the Company to take notice of the 2d point of this
Complaint
That this appointment of more than two spanish directors
in the Indies has proved a great Delay and Embarrassment
to
