The Comittee having read and Considerd the Minute of
this Comittee of the 27th of Feb: last (which was agreed to by the
Court the next day for having 3 Factors for the Havana
and the rest of the Island of Cuba, and finding upon Examination
that the Voyage from St. Jago de Cuba to Carthagena is geneeally
about 24 or 25 days, as well as uncertain and Expensive, whereas
the Intercourse between the Havana and St Jago by Land is but
about 7 or 8 days, besides the Inconvenience that may attend the
putting St Jago under a different Management from that of
Havana (as is that of Carthagena) The Comittee are therefore
of opinion, That St Jago, instead of being dependent on the
Carthagena Factory as formerly, that it be part of and under
the Direction of the Havana Factory
The Comittee made a progress in Settling the Tariff
of Charges on the Sales of 550 Negroes, computed to be Sold Ann=
=ally by the Factory at the Havana and St Jago, and on the
Returns, and intend to proceed in Settling the same at next
meeting.
