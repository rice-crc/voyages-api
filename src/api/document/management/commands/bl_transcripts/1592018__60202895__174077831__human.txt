I am very sorry you sold no more than 1000 [S.S] E
at 295 for me, & wish you could dispose of
four or five thousand pounds more at those
price or thereabouts; & desire as soon as you
can you will. Our Stocks begin a little to
sure but the Searcity of money keeps them
down, & the Bank not discounting foreign
bills this Searcity still greater [Ss] to day
got up to 210 when it comes to 270, IÂ 
desire you'l sell what I have above mention'd
unless you see it in a way of rising Still
higher in w^ch case your Own Judgment
will guide you, as I make no doubt but
Your friendship to me, will encline you, to
Sell at the best market price.

Beck, had he contented himself with his
proper business vizt. of Commission, He could
not have fail^d to have been one of the
richest men in England, but the desire of
growing immensely rich too soon hath
ruin'd him. as for S^r. Mr. D: M^r Pels may
depend upon it, that were all stocks fallen
to Nothing & buried in the Earth, He will
be worth at Least One Hundred thousand
pounds Sterl: & I am very glad his punctu-
ality hath given such Satisfaction to those
Worthy Gentlemen M^r Pels.
Y^r. Judgment about our Stocks is certainly
very right, for as long as Our Merchants
must sell Stock to pay their Bills, the
