is not a little uneasy to me, especially when I
consider the indiscretion I was guilty of in
not selling as much as would quitt clear me whilst
I was a nett gainer of 855,000 pounds w^.ch was my
condition a month ago. I have now 47000: Cap'.
in the south Sea (besides what is still to be
added to it for the second annuity Subscription
to w^.ch I subscribes upward of 700 £  anny
I have 141:^[in] Cap. Ind. 10: ^[in] Cap. Bank & 40:^[in]
Cap. Africa: likewise three Mortgages on Land
amounting to about 80000 £ this is the Chiefe
of my Personal Estate, now I on about 70000£
& my misfortune is, the Scarcity of mony
is such, that I cannot raise ten thousand
pound any manner of way I have try'd
 nor can I sell such a quantity of Stock at
any Rate. on the other Side, the Persons, I
or I realy beleive are in earnest, when
they tell me they are exceedingly prest
for it & my Case: I fear will be when Stock,
are come down to almost par, I shall be
oblidged at that time to part with my
Effects in the Funds at that price, tho there
is a moral certainty that in two or three
months time things pill recover pretty well
again, the favour therefore I would ask of
you is to lend thirty or forty thousand pounds
for which I'l transfer to Your Order a sufficient
security either upon Land or in the stocks,
if this can be effected either by paying it into
Mr. Pels, or by Sending over any parcel in [specie]
