Sir
I was just going to set pen to paper to
return You My humble thanks for your first Lettr
of this Date, when I recd. the Additional fav^r.
of y^r friend. I cannot imagine from whence then
Letters should Come to you & Sr Mathew unless
from Mr. Pels, who perhaps thay have got Nohc
of the draughts, & out of Friend^s. to me have
sent this Advices, which they would not put their
Name too, not having perhaps a mind the
Drawer should know they had found but hys
Correction.Â  I ever hi however certain He had not
the intention of doing ill by me, fines if he had,
He had it in his power having had you know
the Mony [Money] in his Hands, these three freely. He
hath sent me back again the Bills with his
Name cancell'd (& which I return you enclosed) & this
He did, which doth not savour like any ill design
upon the first order I sent him to this purpose
Since Sr. Math. knows it I would not endearseer to
make it any further Secret to Him, & if you'l
please to lett him, that you accepted them as
My desire, & suppose they were drawn upon the
Accd. of some Negotiation I was making in full:
but that upon the little prospect Here is of
making any advantage from the Funds.
