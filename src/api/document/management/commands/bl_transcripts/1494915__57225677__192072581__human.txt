Cloar for Jidge Consowator Oud of the greatest powde & Authoity, and is
not lyable to be Cubed or Intinedted by Arsone of Siperior Authority
And here wee are to observe to you That Mr Bodell in hhis Letter from
Megiro of the 22 Septrs last, Speaking off the Govr. of vork Ciny boin
susporded by the visealy Arquante no That his Excellency had given
him Leave to In ffour ne that he would take our Affairs under his
medite protertion, which would be much more for om Interest than to have
a formal Judge Contervator. If that were the Cwo Wee are of
Opinon You aight to have lnbred the Opportunity, And of you think
the vice Roywill Condestend to arept of that office and that he is
Iulued to Sewe ne You ae to take the proper Methods in applying
poureltfe to him, and desire him to acopt of it, upon which whe
suppose he will appoint some person ander hi to take Care of our
Affaire at VeraCiy, but this wee must leave to your sindence to act
in it se as may be most for one service.

instead of that wee don't find you took any step towards it by petition
or otherwise, but on the Contrary made Applitacion for Buying them, tho' at

with Design of illicit Trading: Wee also observe that tho' the price
Limtted by the Vice Roy At which he granted Leave to sell was but
120 Ps 8/8 P Head, Mr Thorowgood wrote you, you could not give
more yet you bought his Cargo at 160 Ps 8/8 P Head One with
another, and wee to pay the Dutyes, for which you give in no other
Reason then this, that if you had not so Done, you must have gone
without
