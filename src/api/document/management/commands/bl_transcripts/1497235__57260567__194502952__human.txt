Sir
Younill have received a fen Lines from the Sub Govern is
the absence of the Committee for Correspondence & Factorys on the 15t Inst
in Answor to your Letters of the 18.20 & 21 dd to which We refer you
Yours of the 22d 25 & 27 d are Since received with the Sacket from
Mr Keene, which Incloses the Answer of the Marg de la Saz by order
of Mr Patino, to his memorial concerning the Ships demanded to
carry stores from hence to bring away the Sd. Frederick. Our Answer
to him Copy of which we here inclose, will so fully inform you of our
Sence of that Matter, as well as what farther Directions are given him
relating to the demand of a Cedula for the Annual Ship, and on the
Points of Aleavalas, & Internation and also what you will rcasionaly
have to do thereupon; That there needs no repetition thereof, We think
that without waiting for his imparting to you the Account of his
Sucess, You shoul be prepard with your Conditional Complaint on
Account of the Difficultys and disputes about alcavalas and the fedutas
which revokd the Liberty of Internation given by that of the 27t Sept
1721 lest by their being left in dispute without any Concern or Care
at the Congress We be told hereafter, They are points given up, by not
having been mentiond at the Congress or so much as reford to Comissare
before whom We suppose all our Subjects of Complaint are to be laid
This is the more necessary to Caution against, because the Marg de
la Sax Argues in the like manner in Respect to the demand of
Storeships, in the 3d Paragraph of his Answer beforementioned
where he says deforma que no parcze que los directores de la
Compania del Sur puidan tener Motivo por EstaRazon depedis
el permiso de Embiar los Citados Vageles a la Vera Couz quando No
to turreron de Sollicitarlo al tumps de Nipular el Prattode del
Pardo on el qual no se ignorava la repugnancia de S.M. en
permitter &c therefore you must advise with our Plenipotentiarys
hereupon
We
