however for the future I desire both Estates
may be put into the same Sheet of paper &
[pout] ? me up the Week after the Subsequent
half year becomes due, as you used to do
with that of Ahton & Grafton, & if you
receive the Rents sooner, they may as well
by in yr hands & better than in the
Tenant for this reason I donâ€™t Send you
down the Rentall of [Fustley] Sign'd, because
I expect it up a fatnight hence with
the other; & then one sheet & One Signing
will suffice. What you expect from Mr. [Men]?
for the Quacter Rent Anr 16.5 I think
but very reasonable, pray let him know
that after the extraingant rate he made
me pay for the purchase of it, I cannot
but wonder, he should [Seraple]? it & that
I hope he'll consider better, & make no
further difficulties about it. I have not
heard from him or Maj. Crosby about
it I am not very certain has much
the Real to the Dean & Chapter is but
whatever it is, I desire it may h always
punctually paid, & youl take care that
Mr. Mee discharges that Quarter belonging to
him to pay. that I may have no demand
upon [i oye] that score.
I make no question but You'l do as well
for mne as you can in the Composition you are
at.
