To Rebert Cross Esqr. President
and the rest of the Royal British
Assiento Comps Factors at Bus Ayres
Gent
Inclosed is Copie of our last of the 23d January,
the Essex Capt Nathaniel Smith freighted for taking in 400 Negroes
at Angola to be deliverd to you, Since which we have heard nothing
from you Neither the King William nor St. Quintin being yet
arrived
We have lately reced an account from Capt. Opie of
the Cartaret (who we advised you was by Contract with the Royal
Afican Company to take in from their Agents at Cabenda 400
Negroes) of the Disappointment he met with occasioned by the
Destruction of their Settlement there by the Portuguese, having taken
in but 248 Negroes or thereabouts, the like Disappointment (if not a
Total one) may also attend our other Ship the Sea Horse Capt Moore
White, which was likewise under Contract to take in from the said
Companys Agents 325 Negroes at the same place, unless upon such
an Emergency the Capt. Should have acted the prudent part, and Emplo
the Cargo which was put onboard here in purchasing Negroes to Answer
this Contract, as well as a further number to Compleat what were
wanting in the Carteret which if he has done, the African Comp
have by a Minute of their Court approved of.
This comes by the Levantine Capt John Thomas
freighted by us with a Cargo of Goods Suitable for the purchase
of Augosa
of 380 Negroes at the Coast of Angola of which ships Charter party
Inclosed is abstract for your Government
