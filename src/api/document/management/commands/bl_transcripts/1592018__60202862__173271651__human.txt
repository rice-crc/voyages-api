Dr. Capt.
You will find by my last
that I am much of yr Opinion
concerning Mr Rouse, & indeed I have so
bad an one of him, that I will have nothing
to do with his Estate, unless he can make
it very plainly appear there are no
Dormant Incumbrances
I shall, take care to reserve as much
Money out of the last Payment to M.H.
Powell, as will clear the Proportion of the
Law with which belongs to him to dischar^ge
Â E 10 g& Sixpence & shall be glad to know
how much you juoge the other Assessment
will amount to
You shall have a Copy sent you of
Mr Gravenors, particular as soon as
I have it my self.
Mr Caleb Powells writing I dont
hear are yet come up
What have you done
with Mr. Brown of
Bishops Castle
