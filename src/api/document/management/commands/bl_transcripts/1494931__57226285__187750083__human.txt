into the Kingdoms above, and the Imprartiability of Litteraly com
-plying with the 9th Article by which we seem to be restraind to the
selling 800 of the 1200 ps of India at Buenos Ayres; We shall also
represent the other Doubt which you mencon has been raised, as if
even the other 400 can not be carried into the Provinces above and King
dom of Chili unless the people will come to Buenos Ayres to buy them,
and indeed as the Letter of this Article soms to be against us in both
points, and at the same time our whole Trade at your settlement depends
upon it, we shall with equall Earnestness sollicit the Explanation
desired, to which end your Governors Letter to his C.M: wherein he
agrees with the Allegations of your Representation will be of use, and
we hope by your prudent Management youll be able to Stave of any
Mischief from this new difficulty till we can get the matter Explained
at Madrid, which we shall push with all possible Expedition; But
if we obtain the free introduction you propose of the Negroes, special
care ought to be taken either in the Bills of sale or some other Method
to prevent their interfering with our Sales at Panama, this having
been formerly matter of Complaint, and we would by all possible
means prevent doing any prejudice to that Market, it being the
principal Vent for the Negroes and where they sell for the best prices
upon this occasion we think proper to give you a paragraph of a
Letter we have just now reced from Mr Swartz our Factor now at
Lima dated there the 5d June last viz

Aripique 300 Leagues from hence Introduced by the Portuguese
near Buenos Ayres, I sent one to seize them, but they produced
a Dispatch from that Factory, tho never a Negro Markd
alledging it was not the Custom there, The Person sent, contiute
himself with that Answer, but I have sent him a second
Order
