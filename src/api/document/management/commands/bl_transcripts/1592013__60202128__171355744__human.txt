Sir,
I was very Sorry when I came home this Evening to find
I had miss'd the Honour of receiving your Commands, but as I
intend to be in Town the beginning of next Week I desire You'll
let me wait on you, as soon as I come, that I may be favoured
with them, I hear there is a Scheme for carrying on the Affr: (African) Trade
and some People have been pleased without my knowledge
to place me at the Head of it, as others without any Consent or
Authority from me have taken the Liberty in my Name to disown
it, be it as it will I'me apt to think the Scheme will succeed and
being pswaded (persuaded) of this, I cannot forget one I have such a Value
for I wou'd therefore beg to know if you have any Inclination to be an
Adventurer, and in Case You have how much are You willing to
Subscribe the fund will be two Millions and the Payment 10 P
Cent down and the other 10 P Cent more at to Mo^nths Distance
the Subscriptions given in come to upwards of three Mill^n(Millions)
but you may be assur'd yours shall be taken Care of whoever
else happens to be left out I am with great respect Sir
Your &.
or 20ne
Mr. Pells
