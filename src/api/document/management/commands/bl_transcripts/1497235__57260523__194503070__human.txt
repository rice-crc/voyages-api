Sir,
The Court of Directors of the South Sea Company being
Adjournd for a short time as usual at this Season of the Year, the Sub
Governor is pleas'd to Comand me to acquaint you that your Letter of the
14 Instant in reply to that part of mine of the 11t July relating to the
Store Ship, is come safe to hand, And that it's matter of surprize
the Court of Spain should still persest in their denial of so Just and
reasonable a thing as the Companys request is. And in regard that
the Executon of the Proposal You advise is now made by His CM
That the Company may send the numerous Stores Provisions and
Men from Jamaica to Vera Cruz by their Negro sloops, Will be
attended with many Difficultys, notwithstanding the Assiento
is now Current and the said Sloops as you write, will be
Admitted without opposition, You are therefore desired to
continue your Sollicitations that His CM will be graciously
please to grant the Companys said Request In the mean
time the Expedient before mention'd will be taken into Considera
tion, that so if you cannot prevail the best may be done that
We can
In a post or two Sir You will be informd of the sentiments
of the Court hereupon as also touching the matters which Mr
Rigby has signified he has made mention of to you, which being
approvd You are also desired to be making the proper steps therein
I am with all Regard and Respect
