Gentlemen
Our last was of the 4th October Vic Jamaca Copy Mil
Since which have none from you, only one from Capt. Williams of th
1 of August Vee Gibralter, advising the arrival of the Orders fr hesp
to the Restoring the P. Frederick, and the snows being also orderd p h
deliver'd up and hope soon to hear of the Restitution of the Pd. Fredirictk
Cargo, and the other Effects, as well those under the Cactory's Carege s
own We know not well how to direct you in the Cautions that may be
necessary with regard to the Confiancas, whether you should forthwith
take the possession of them, or wait till you are near Sailing and our
Difficulty amises from this, That in the present Uncertainty whether
the peace will absolutely take place, It is not impossible, tho We
think Improbable, that Counter Orders may be sent by Spain, bet
your Sailing for a Rescizure, and on the Other hand, As we undertan
orders have been some time since Sent for Coyning Pss of a New
Weight & Standard, possibly even those previously Coynd, may be calld
in and prohibited to be Exported. These are Circumstances that Wee
must hust to your prudence to Conduct your Selves through, And the
Means of Secuering our Concerns and Interest from further Embroits,
also be in your own Judgement, not doubting but you will preserve
your Selves well able to Satisfye us, that you transact erery ther
for our best Advantage
We have now actually ship'd the Men, Stores & Neccessarys
for the Prince Frederick and the snows at Vera Cour and the Uft
by which they go are on the point of sailing for Jamaica from
whence they will be imediately forwarded to Vera Couz by Some
Assd Vessel, pursuant to the method we acquainted you in ourled
we were put upon by the Court of Spain, and We hope they will in
be with you
If therefore the Ship that Shall bring you the Store
be a good one, and yon have the Opportunity by her Sailing larte
away than the Pd. Frederick, you will Embark on her what
Effects you Can, for Jamaica, Consign'd to Messrs Rigby and
Pratter to be forwarded to England, We should be please to hee
you had made some Returns by the Solebay Man of Warph
We suppose was to return back to Jamaia, We have nothin
at present further to Add, but to Continue to Recomend to ye
