1720 April 8
Colonel
Sir
Butler
I was very sorry to find by y^e fav^r
of ye of 31 March that y^r Affairs will not
permit you to buy the Lieut Colonel's Comission
vacant in Lord Hunchin brokes Reg^l. but as I
have reason for w^t you write to apprehend you many
be in a mistake concerning the prices fixt by
the New Regulation, I take the Liberty of troubling
you w^th this to Let you write right in hopes that
it may be a means of contributing to y^r Advancemnt
in the World, where the Character you have acquired
cannot fail of raising you to make a Considerable
Figure. A price then, 1t. for a Lt. Col. Commt.
in this Reg^t. instead of being advanc^d 500^t. in price
is reduc'd to be sold for 2000^L. w^ch is cheaper than w^t
you agreed for it & ye benefit of this reduction I amÂ 
very willing & think it very just you sh'd have.
so y^t there will be only ye difference for you to raise
between what you sell your Majors Poft for & wt.
you are to give for ye Lt. Colonel's Viz. 2000^E. if
your Circumstances will not permit you to raise this
Sum (w^ch I presume cannot be above 600 for I think
a Maj^r Poft is rated at 1400) if you'l please to let
Me know how much you can supply your self toward
it I'l try to accomodate you w^th ye remainder for as
I have a real value for your merit, I sh'd be sorry
this Opportunity Shou'd be Cost, whereby you might
do your self so much Service
I am &c
