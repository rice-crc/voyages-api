We approve your Applying for putting a stop to ye Indulto
set on foot by the Gov of Havana wch as it is a violation of a Right
solely in the Company and of so fatal Consequence to their future Trade
calls for a loud Complaint Mr Nicholson writes us, that it was done
under pretence or colour of an antiquated Permission from the K of Spain
set forth in the Autos in your possession, to wc you will have recourse for
better Information, and we believe you will be of opinion with us, that
altho in cases of Ruptures between the two Crowns, the Assiento is accord
to the 40 Art to be Suspended yet nothing less than an Annihilation can
so far divest us of it, as to put it in the power of others others (even with

could not disprove and were we to be excluded a right to ye Negroes
Introduced during a Rupture how easily would all seizures be
Avoided our Indulting being rendred impractcable & consequently
Clandestine Importations be encouraged in future, and the Compa
would in a great measure be disabled from Vending the number of
Negroes for which they are obliged to pay Dutys, It being as
impractieable to distinguish the Negreoes Introduced during the
Rupture as it was formerly to distinguish those Introduced
before our time from those afterwards; so that a parity of reason
