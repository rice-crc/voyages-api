L^r Carnaroon can set forward on his travells
so that he may go & be back again: time
enough to alboy with him. I shall alwaies [always]
acknowledge the obliging Disposition on the
occation [occasion]& be very glad to be him when ever
He pleases to call here.
As to the Affair of M^r Pye about which
You have had so much & I am like to have
So much more trouble, what I have to desire
of Ayon, is, that you'l be so good to let him know
Since He is not for Selling his whole Estate
in Herefordsh: at present  upon the terms
I have offered He is not to expect y^rSir
the like for the Remainder hereafter on the
Contrary I then declare I will not: but for
that part which He by now willing to part
with let him Send me a particular of
it, which I'l send down  to my Steward to
examine & to send me up an Estimate
of the expence of the repair will amount to,
& at the same time to enquire of the Tenant's
whether there is any probablity of joyning (as
He abledges.) farm, together in order to make
them layer, & there by Save some thing of the
Charge of repairs, which when he compleats
will cont so little, argues how little how
understand the Estate, Since I am assur'd
there is not one farm Haust which is not so
miserably out of Order, as not to require a
New & building.
