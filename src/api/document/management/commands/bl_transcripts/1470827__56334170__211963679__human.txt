Mr Thorongood attending was Calld in And having given the
Committee his Reasons for coming from Vera Cruz without Leave
And the Committee having Considered the whole in as Impartial
a light as the Distance of time since those Transactions, will admit,
are at a loss to know why so Severe a Censure was passd on Mr Thorowgard
or if at the time of passing the said tote of Incapacity, therewas by what
then appeard sufficent Ground, for so doring This Committee thing that by
what Cxaminations appear to have been Since made and Acct. and other papors
delivered which gave a llearer Light in to these procedings between him and
the Factory Mr Thorongood has been fully sustified, as to all his transutias
abroad in the Companys Service; even by the same Court of Directors who
past the said lensure upon him, Except as to his Coming home without
leave first had. In which he was Certainly Srima facie Vorymuch to
Blaine, for he had Entred in to Articles with the Company to Serve them
for 5 years and in Case he had left the Service for any private Concerns of
his Own, It ought not to have been forgiven, But it does not appear to
the Committee, that he came home to carry on his own Interest, or
with any Intention of Prejudiuce to the Company, but for their Service,
as appears by his Memorial to the Company of the 3d. Decr. 1716 where
he gives his Reasons at Large.
And this Committee are of Opinion his coming home as he did
has been of Service by his giving the Company Personally an Account
of what they were to expect from the proceedings of that Sactory, and
putting the Court in away of remedying the growing Mischief, and
therefore all tho the Committee can not perfectly excuse him of all blame
for Coming home without leave first had, they are however of Opinion
Mr Thorowgood is Capable of Serving the Company in any Station
the Court shalf think fitt to employ him
Resd
That the foregoing Report he laid before the Court
Read in Court and agreed to
