friends of my own y endeavour'd with some of the

Madam
Mr Baron Fortescues letter hath as much Surprisd
me as yours did him; I find by the Contents of it, I have been
led into a mistake concerning the Subject He wrote about for
I thought from what you had been pleasd to acquaint me
with, that the match you mentiond, was, what his Own incli
=nations led him to not the expectation of healing upon
such a Foot as either his own merts or his Circumstances
not
might entitle him to Mr. Baron doth consider I have a dozen
Neeces (besides more who may be coming) to provide for, as
well as several other relations whom friendship engages
me to take care of & what I have offer'd to my Coz: Jeffrys
tho I am Sensible tis not worth S. Johns taking any notice
of is as much as I think from me to one, who tho' a Relation
hath been always a Stranger to me & for any thing I remem
ber to my Father before me.
