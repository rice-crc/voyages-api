We Observe with Surprise what you write as to the Cedula for
Introducing the Negroes from the Plantations and cannot Conceive from what
way of thinking you suppose twill Answer Our Ends, It Seems we are to have
a Liberty of refreshing the Negroes 20or 30 days And that none are to be
Admitted but what are Newly come from Africa. Is it not too plain from
hence we shall meet with great Imbarrassments from the Scrupulous Spaniards
for which this Cedula, Contrary to your Opinion, is directly Calculated and
what Testimonys we are to Send with the Negroes to Obviate them we know not
neither do you Inform us, tho as the Cedula runs, theres no Introducing the
Negroes without them, We shall be also under a difficulty with regard to such
Negroes as we are under a Necessity oft times of Buying at Jamaica being
restraind to such only as are newly Arrived; had you taken this Matter in the
View we shew it you, you would have Judged better and told the Ministers we
desired no such explanation and that we desired no Cedula of to dangerous a consequence
