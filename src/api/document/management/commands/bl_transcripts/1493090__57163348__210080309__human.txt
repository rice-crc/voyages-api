that Trade so far as he is concerned, In Case it shall appea
by the 5 Years Accounts thereof, and Accounts of the Annual
Ships granted within the same time That upon the whole
there is a Loss Sustained, We humbly hope it will be
thought reasonable that sucth part of the Loss as His CM
is by the said 28 Article to make Good, shall be reimbursd
out of his Share of the Profits of the Annual Ships, and
therefore that such Share ought not to be paid to His CM
before it can be known what the Loss upon the whole
Shall amount to
As to the Argument drawn by His Exy M Patino
from what was practisd with respect to the Gains & Profits
of the Lrmce William in the Year 1730 We beg leave to observe
that it was only a Concession in order to shaw the Companys
Rreadiness to gratify His CM which we presume
sufficiently appears by Sir Thomas Gerallinos Decipt
given for the same, a Copy whereof le think proper to
Transmit herewith
And since it is now drawn into a Precedent in order to
oblige us to future payments in like Manner, We think we
ought to be the more Cauhous how we give new strength to
this Argument in prejudice to the just Right of the Company
Upon the whole We humbly hope that what we hav
now laid before your Grace will be deamed Satisfactory
Answer to the Complaints made against Us, & fully Sughty
our proceding in this Affair
