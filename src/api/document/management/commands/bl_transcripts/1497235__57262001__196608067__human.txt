London 25 Decemr. 1729
Our last was of 20 Novmber, owning recept of your
of the 10th of that Month Nsr Our SubGovernor has since Comunicated to
us the Letter you wrote him from Seville of the 25th past in relation to
the Cedulas, and the causes of their retardment But as the hurry
is now probably over We are impatsently expecting them, being
confirnd in our opinion of the necessity there is for them, and that
CartaOrdenes are not of equal validity or so well regarded, an
Instances whereof We have been informed of from private hands
who seed Letters from Buenos Ayres by the Brasit Fleet, guin
an Account that the Register ships that sailed from Cadiz about
Christmas last with the Preliminanes and other Dispatches
amved there in April last, And that the Governor did not think
fit to shew the least regard thereto, telling our Factory that he could
take no notice of any Preliminary Articles or other Orders for making
Restitution &o than such as should be Signed by his Cmo himself
in the same manner as was done for putting the Reprisalia or fort
From whence it must be Inferrd that the Carta Ordenes you sent us
for Buenor Ayres will likewise not be complyed with, which would
be a very great disappointment, If therefore you shall not have
procured there before this reaches you, We desire youll press their
Dispatch with all possible Parnestness for all our Factorys, but
at present for Buenor Ayres in particular, For thi our Store Ship
is ready to proceed and lyes at great Charges, we chose to detain
her till we have the proper Cedulas to send by her
This fwriteby order of the Court of directors, and am
Sir,
Yor mostobed hum Senr
