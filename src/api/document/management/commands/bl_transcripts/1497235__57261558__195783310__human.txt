last, that in discourse you had with Mr Patino on this head He told
you he must know what had passed in the Junta wn the last License
was granted, You will observe We never had any particular License or
ever asked for one chosing to avoid it, lest we should thereby shew
a diffidence of what we take to be a Right by the 34th Act of the
Assiento and by that means lay ourselves open to a denial at pleasure
and as that Article had provided some Conditions to be comply'd with
on our part on the sending out these Ships, when these Condition
were performed the rest of the Article, if it meant anything, must
amount to an absolute grant, and the Trusting as is therein
mentions That his CM would give leave was only an Idiom or
phrase to denote the complaisance of the Concession, and were the Art
to be taken in any other sense We don't see the use of it; for by his
CMs leave We might send the stores without that Article, nor can
it be supposed that the Assiento which enjoyns the Company to introduce
a certain large number of Negroes Annually particularly at Buenos
Ayres & to pay Duties for them is to be binding on the Company and
at the same time they to be under the precarious Circumstance of being
denied the necessary Provisions & stores for their Subsistance, We
hope therefore his CM will put the same Construction on this Art
as We do, and not insist on our asking leave for what We have abready
a right to at least with respect to the Store Ships for B Ayres And
that in consequence thereof the Securitys which that Factory write
us, they had been obliged to give for bringing his CMs approbation for
the past Store ships may be ordered to be vacated, And as ye time
limitted by the respective Bonds are expired, and in all probability
the money has been levied for want of the aforesaid Approbation
provision should be made for restoring any Money that may have
been taken on that Account
As Mr Patino is curious to know what passes in
the Indies, and We may sometimes hear, when the Spaniards do not We
are willing to oblige him with what advices We may receive so far as
the Comunicating thereof may be proper and have given directions to
Our secretary to transmit the same to you accordingly from time to
Time as any come to hand
We shall have regard to the good Character you have guen
