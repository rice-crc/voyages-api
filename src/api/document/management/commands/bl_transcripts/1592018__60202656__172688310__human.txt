The enclosed Lre I rec.d yesterday Morn &
presume it must be from Mr Clark y^e Relation, pray
if it is will you be so good to enquire of him who M^r
Edward Brydges of Wilton is, I never heard of any of
that Name except he means an Attorney who lived
near Wilton & I remember once collected the Chief &
Copy hold Rents of the Mannover for Me. My Father
You know had never a Brother & all his Unkles
(except Old Gyles Brydges) have been dead these 60
years to that y^e person he mentions can be no Son
of theirs. I desire, if this Gent. who writes the Lre is
y^e Brother Law, that you'l pleas to acquaint him
I shall alway, have a great regard for his Recomendation,
but must hope, he'l be so good as to point out, the
Way in w^ch I Can be serviceable to y^e Person he
recommends, for that I dont know of any thing it is
in my power to do for him Lady Hoskins &c
your self have humble services from all here as due.
