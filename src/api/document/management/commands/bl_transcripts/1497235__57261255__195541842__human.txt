You are to informd us thereof sending us Authuntick Testimonys, that
We may ground our demand thereupon for a particular Cedula for
explaining this Point
35.- And whereas We have been credibly informed that great
numbers of Negroes have been Introduced into the several parts of the
Spanish West Indies, through the Encouragement given by the

when Negroes may be much wanted at one or other of the Factorys
We think fit to direct that if our Agents at Jamaica shall send you
