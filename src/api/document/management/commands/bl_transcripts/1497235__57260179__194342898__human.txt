Mr. Bumpsted
Sir
Our Sub Governour has comcanicated to us you
Letter to him of the 24 Decemr from Antegoa, with a Postcript
of the 26 D concerning the Condition and Condemnation or
our Ship Royal George, and the Escape you say you have tha
of foundering at Sea; Other private Letters have come to our
knowledge concerning this Affair, which do not well agree with
what you write, and which give us a reasonable doubt of the
necessity either of your Deviation to Antegoa or of condemnin
the ship, But however ill or imprudent this proceeding may
prima facie appear, we shall suspend our Judgment of it, till
we can be more fully and Satisfactorily inform'd of the truth &
Circumstances of the Case. It has occasioned much noise and
Clamor in the Town, who seem prejudiced in Opinion that this
has been done with a fraudulent intention against the Insurers,
altho by the Paragraph of your Letter on this Occasion to Messr
Furness and Wright, which has been comunicated to us, we
are unwilling to Entertain so hard an Osinion, and we trust
youwill be able to Satisfy us and the World, that you have done
nothing but what necessity required.
Under this unhappy and So Surprising a Circumstance
we do consent and order that all our Treasure should be put on boar
the Kingsale Man of Warr, for which you must take the proper
Bills of Lading
And as to the matter of the condemnd Ship, it is our
Strict and positive Order, that you do not on any account or pre
=tence whatsoever alionate the property of her, or dispose of
