all the Lycenses are Issued, least doing it from your Island should
Interfere and cause Speculation among the Spaniards, which may
tend to diseredit the Lycenses from Jamaica for this Reason we have
vested our Agents at Jamaica with Powers which we hope will be
Effectual for putting a Stop for the future to the Illict Trade both of
Sisson and Ottley and blow up the pretended Factory, the latter as you
write us has Set up at Porto Rico.
We have perused the Accot Curt which Sisson delivered
you, and find he charges himself with all the Negroes he alledges to have
Introduced into the Spanish West Indies, distinguishing what were
before, and what after the Warr, Except some fow at Cumana, of which
he says he had not reced any accot of their Sales; but as he has Introduced
Several since a further Charge must be added, The Indulto he therein
Charges himself with is £30 Barbadoes Money P ps of India for these
Introduced before the Warr into Carraccas, because he says he made some
Proffits in the Flower Carried with them, But as to the Negroes wch
he Introduced at St Domingo, Coro, and Maracaybo, he thinks it
Reasonable to charge himself but with ₤24 because he made (as he
alledges) no Profits on the Fruits taken in Payment.
And as to the Negroes he Introduced Since the Warr
we find he offers but 60 $ ps of India, which widely differs from what
we limited you to offer him which was 100 $ for all he had Introduced
without distinction of Times or Places.
As to the Credit he gives himself in the said Accot
we find it very Extaordinary in many Instances, and is what he
must not Expect we will allow, he having charged us with his Losses
Damages
