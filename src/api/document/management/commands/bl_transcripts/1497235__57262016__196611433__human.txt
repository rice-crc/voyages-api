London 8th Jany 1729
Sir
Since my last of the 20th past the Court of Directors have
received yor pacquit from Sevill of the 22 of that Month with the enclosed
Dupls of the Restitution & other Cedulas wt feem to be very well worded
and in the usual form; but it has been objected that if there were particul
Cedulas for Buenos Ayres it would prevent the loss of time in sending
these first to the Vice Roy at Lima before they can be put in Execution
As they are directed to the Subsidinate Gov &c as will as the Vice
Roys there ferms no Occasion think for a particularones, However
should be glad to have yor opinion. We are expecting the letter You
promised us from Mr Patino to the Govr. of Buenos Ayres: I wish
You many years of happiness & prosperity being with all truth
& regard
Sir,
Yor most Obedt humble Servt
D. Wescomb
