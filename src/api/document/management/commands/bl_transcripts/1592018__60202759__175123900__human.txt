Sir
I am much concernd my endeavours to serve
you with Mr Secretary have hitherto provd
To little Successfull & Icannot but hope an
opportunity will offer in some time whereby
he may be able to do you the good offices I
am perswade he is inclined to. As for what
you are please to write to me about, I should
very willingly comply with your Comand was
there any grounds for the report you mention
of a New Subscription going to be open? for
the Afr. Comp. I know of None I assure you &
am perswared no one of the Company thinks
of any such thing but rather that the Capital
is already too large, there is a Subscription
going to be taken for the South Sea Company
& if you are incline to come into that, Ile
endeavour to serve you being very Sincerely
