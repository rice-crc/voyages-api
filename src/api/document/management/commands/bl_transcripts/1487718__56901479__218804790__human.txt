Mr Bumpsted also deliverd a Third paper likewise hereto
annexed, being a Declaration of two free Negroes at Panama made
before the Scrivner of the place and dated 12 May 1725 containing in
Substance That they saw at a place calld Guayabal, but they dont
remember the day nor Month, Two Factors Swartz and Johnson
marking about 200 Negroes, That they heard they were Illicit
Introduction but knew not the Truth, That they knew not who
brought them nor where they were carried they being only Passen-
-gers passing that way; To this Mr Johnson was particularly
Examined who says the whole is a base falsity, That he never was
with Mr Swartz there, That the place is on a high Road, where 500
Loaded Mules pass in a day, and therefore the most unlikely for such
a Transaction.
Mr Hutchinson another Bookkeeper Employ'd by that
Factory was also Examined to this Fact who says he never heard of
such a thing, That if it was true to Impossible but he must have
heard of it, and confirms its being a publick High Road, as well as
that 'tis out of the way for Such Introduction, and therefore Im-
probable to be true; and that tis Impossible it could be a Secret, For
that Transactions of that kind are immediately known
Mr Hutchinson being further Asked if he had heard of
any offers or indirect attempts to procure Evidence against Swartz
and Johnson, said he had heard So from them upon which they
were calld in and they both declared they had reason to think So, and
Swartz produced a Letter to him dated in Panama the 3 December
1724 from the Providor of that place, acquainting him with the
base Attempts of Darrock and Bleckynden to procure Evidence
against him, and Mr Johnson produced a Letter from Harwood
to him dated the 20th May 1727 wherein he acquaints him. That
Darrock and Blechynden had used the Vilest Mathods for the
same purposes, both the Letters are hereto Annext
Mr Bleckynden Says he shall soon have the Evidence
