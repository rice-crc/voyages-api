of Argument, if they begin the Objection
An Adequate Satisfaction for this Loss of our Priviledge, is indeed
a Subject that shoud be under the Consideration of the Congress, and if you
find any difficulty on your Application You must apprize Mr Rigby
at Soissons, that he may make it one of our Complaints to be redressd
After the fedula for the Annual Ship is granted, The Points of Sertomation
of our Goods, & freedom from Alearalas, Should also be there forthwith Settled
The best Argument for support of the freedom from Aleavalas are the Assunte
Featy it self, which Expresly says the Goods by the Annual Ship Shall be
free of Dutys in the Indies ad will as the Conditions upon which the grant
of the Same is made, Vizt. (vide the Article) In Consideration of the Losses
former Assientists had sustaind, and a Duty of 5p C to be paid out of
the profits of 7 parts His Cill being himself Concernd the /4 of the
From whence tis plain this Ship was intended to be of particular
Advantage to the Company and the 5f paid Seems to be, the not Expristy
Duty in lieu of other Dutys in the Indies
The Spanish Words of the Treaty in this Respect, may indeed bear a
Construction, That the Goods Shall be sold free of Duty in the ports only &
during the time of the fair, and Consequently if they are sold in the Inland
Country, or where there is no fair, that in those Cases Dutys Shall be paid
To this We say The Company would be Content to pay the Duty of
aleavalas, in Case they shoud remove their goods into the Country, to any
place from the fair or shoud their Annual Ship be in any port when
no flota or Galcons are Expected. But if they are arrived and the Fair be
not held in port, There is a necessity that the Companys Goods, as those
of the Flotistas always are, should be carryed to the place where it is
to be held, and being sold there at the time and place of the Tair
tho not in Port, the Exemption from Dutys is equally within the
just Construction of the Article, And therefore under such Construction
So qualify'd, We should make no further dispute with them about
the Matter of Dutys
The necessity of Internation of Goods or rather the priviledge
of it is stonn in the st Paregraph, for if the Plotistes &c
internate their Goods to Morico or other place where the Fair is
kept, and the Companys Goods are forbid, It is impossible to
Sell
