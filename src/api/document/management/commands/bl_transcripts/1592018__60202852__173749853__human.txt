D^r Sir
I have rec'd both y^r oblidging Letters
of the 15th & the 18th N: that which you sent by
the Express is not yet come to Hand, I suppose
the Messenger must have been taken ill on
the Road. I return you my very hearty thanks
for your read complaince with the Request I
made you which hath been of very great
service to me, & which I shall never forget to
acknowledge with all the Gratitude imaginable
the Chander Sloop is not yet anrved, but I hear
from M^r. Tenceif He hath ship't the Guineas
on Board, we expect her every hour. I by the
fav^r of you to let me know her feen you wou'd
desire this mony (for which I send You a Note
in Case of Mervality) should be repaid You
that I may accordingly take care to make
provision for it, & likewise that Garil send me
heod to whom I shall tranfer, the 30000 Ind: Stock
which I purpose for y^r. further Security. I confess
as people & Characterare very dubious at this
Juncture here in England, I should be glad if
you would let it be transferr'd to Y^r. Hon Name
& send Over a Letter of Attorney to any friend
of Yours to Accept it for you.
