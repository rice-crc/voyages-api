Correspondence and Factorys of the 23 Instant, which was re=
=comitted to them by the Court, in relation to the making some
Satisfaction to the Familys of Such Factors as may hapen
to dye before they get to their place of Factory, or after entring
on the Business at the Factory, and in relation to the Securing
to the Company the Imprest Money which they shall have
advanced to them in London, and are of Opinion that instead of
the provision proposrd in their former Report for the Familys
of Deceasing Factors, It will be more certain to them and
more convenient to the Company, That their Executors &c be
allowd the Comissions which would have accrud to their Testator
upon half the Number of Negroes calculated to be Annually
Introduced at Each Factory respectively, and after that, that
the Company be reimbursd the Imprest money advanced to
the deceasd Factors, or So much thereof as shall not have
been satisfyd by them in their life time out of the Proffits
attending
