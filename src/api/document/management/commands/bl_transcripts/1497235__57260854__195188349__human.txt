So Sea house London 4th Ocbobr 1728
Gentlemen
Since Our last of the 28th April 1726 Wherein We advis'd you the
Situation of Affairs, as to peace or War, We have had no Opportunity of
Writing to you But have Receivd your Several Letters up to the 2d of March
lest with the Spanish and other papers Inclosd, and are Sensibly Concernd
at the hardship you have undorgone by means of the Late unjust and
Rigorous Reprisalie of which We laid our Complaints before his Majesty
who was pleas'd most graciously to Assure the Company of his Protection
And hope before this time you have found the Good Effects thereof in the
Restitution of all that was seix'd, to which End, orders were Recipricoally
Sent on the part of his Majesty and the King of Spain, to our Squadron
and to the Spanish Governors, which We hope have been put in Execucion
and that our Assiento is again Current, With this View and the Prospect
there is of the Congress's coming to a Speedy and happy Conclusion We
are preparing as fast as We can, the Mon Stores and necessarys, to bring
away the Prince Frederick and the Prince of Asturias, which We are
Sending to Jamaia to be forwarded from thence to you, by some Vessel
of sufficient Burthen, Qualifying the same with Negroes, that the
Stores may Appear to come directly from Jamaica, and not from England
Having on our Application at Madrid, for the admission of a Store ship
from England to Vera Cruz been refus'd, and are by that Court, put ay
this method of sending them Via Jamaica, on Negro Vessels, which
pro hae Vice, we have acquiesed in rather than at this Juncture by
our Right to Store Ships
The Court of Spain give this Reason for refusing the desired sn
ships from England, that the Apprehension of her Carrying out Merchan
dize will discourage the Merchants from loading on the Flota designd
next year, which however absurd, they cannot be satisfyd of the Contren
As their Jealousies of Contraventions to the Treaty, are great We have
given our Agents in Jamaica in Charge to be particularly carefull
that no dry Gords, or Merchandize, or any thing but the Companys Stores
be put on board the ship that Shall Carry them
We hope and are purd the Orders for the Restitution and
Opening the trade (of which Inclosd are Copys) will be of Sufficient
Authority with the Spanish officers for admitting the Men stores
&c without which the P. Frederick could not come home &wn
