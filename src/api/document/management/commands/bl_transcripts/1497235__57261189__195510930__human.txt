Ludgers, which our accomptant hath prepared from the foregoing
Iriginal Books, and We hope they will be very useful to you toward
enravelling these Originals Vizt
One General Journal from April 1722 to June 1724
A Ledger of the remains of the Bedfords Cargo
A Leidger of the Royal Georges first Cargo
A Ludger of the Negroes sold at Sanama
17. Our Accomptant has made the following general Observations
sent on the Books and Accounts of the Factory Since the Trade was Opence
again in the year 1721 Esqr
That as all the Accounts relating to former Transactions
were not then Closed, the Factory were to be Accountable for such
Debts as were then outst anding, as they should receive the same
They were likewise to be answerable for the Goods of the
Bedfords Cargo restored by the Royal Officers, For the Goods sent
them by the Royal George Anno 17220; And for the Negroes sent
them by several Ships &c
As to the Debts, they were brought into a New Ledger
and Journal at Panama, which contains likewise some accounts of
Negroes, but these Books are very imperfect being carried on only
to February 1722/3 and never Ballanced, and consequently no Ballances
carried into the next Leidger and Journal of Negroes, wch comences
in October 1724 during which time there is no Account of Sales of
Negroes here, but what are to be found in a foul Journal Continued
to December 1723, or in the Cash Books Continued to June 1724
And as to the Account of Negroes disposed of and other
Transactions at Portobelo, there are no Accounts further than June
1723, except some very Trifling Ones
As to the disposition of the Bedfords Goods, they have
sent over neither Ledger nor Journal, nor any Accounts but what
are to be met with in the aforesaid foul Journal & Cash Bookes
As to the Goods of the Royal George, the Ledger and
Journal
