The Comittee having taken into Consideration the Matter
to them referrd by the Order of the Court of the 20 day of Febt last,
And in Consequence thereof having maturely thought of Such
a Method as may best obviate the Carrying on any Clandestine
Trade in the Companys Ships and Vessells are of Opinion
That as it is of Constant usage to allow Some
priviledge to the Officers of Trading Ships, for their Encouragemt;
and the better Security of Such ships and the Sstate on board It
is in a more dminent degree Important to the Company, That
the Vigilance and Care of the Several Officers on board the Anual
Ships should be Encouraged by an Interest on board in their own
property; and at the same time that such Interest should be known
and Ascertained So as not to Exceed what shall be allowd, and to
that End.
1. That a priviledge of Goods to a certain Value be allowed
