Sir/
You having been Pleased to Inform us that a Cedula
was Expected from Spain for the Departure of the South Sea Cos
Ship which new lyes Laden We beg leave to Acquaint you the
We are Informd the Spaniards are fitting out a Flota for Vera
Cruz & so Probably the Cedula will be for that Post, Whereas
The Comps Ships is Laden with a Cargo fit only for Carthagena
and Porto Belo which is altogether Improper for Vera Cruz
And the Goods by Longer lying in the Ship will be greatly
Damaged, and it will be Impossible in point of times to provide
a Cargo this year proper for Vera Cruz We therefore Pray that
His Majtys Mininstr at Madrid may have Instructions to get
the Cedula Accordingly, And likewise to Obtain a Circular Cedula
to all the Officers in the Indies to Set the Comps Factors at
Liberty & to Disembargue & deliver up to the Said Factors
all the Comps Ships Goods & Effects which have been Seized of
Embargd & the produce of such as have been Sold & likewise
Circular Cedulas for Admitting the Comps Negro Shipps
