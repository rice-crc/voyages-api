The Comittee read the Letters received from the Agents at
Barbados of the 12th April and 10th May
And from Mr Butcher dated at that Island the 12th
April and 6th May
And the Comittee having Considered what directions

Are of opinion That a Letter be wrote to the Companys
Agents at that Island, ordering them in case they find
Mr Butcher has made a profitable Voyage, and that
they apprehend he may make a second Voyage which
may be also profitable, that then they dispatch him
again to the Windward Coast with such a number of
