The Court of directors also intreat you will make pressing
Instances to the Court of Spain to obtain the Revocation of the Cedula
of the 20th Oct. 1724 and 8th Dec. 1726 (which is the other particu-
lar mentiond in the said Memorial) They forbidding the Importa
tion of Negroes from any of the British Colonies, and requiring
them to be brought directly from Africa, which is so contrary
to the Right due to this Nation under the Preliminarys, and
is of that Importance to the Company that the Negro Trade is
renderd wholly Impracticable by such Restriction, so that
till the said Cedulas which the Company is informd are now to
be executed with Rigour are Revokd, the Company must devist
sending out any Ships for Negroes, and having already hired a
Ship to proced for Whidah thereto purchase 480 Negroes and
carry them to Jamaica as usual, in order to their being refreshd
and divided into proper Assortments and sent thence in the Comps
Sloops to the Respective Factorys, yet must the Company detain
her till the sd Cedulas are Revokd, tho' all her Cargo is bought and part
thereof actually laden onboard her whereby the Company will be great
sufferers.
There are other Cdular aholutely necessary also to be reiskd
an Account whereof will be sent you inductimg. I am
