To the Right Honourable the Commons of
Great Britain in Parliament assembled
The humble Petition of the Court of Directors
of the South Sea Company
Sheweth
That many Women are possessed of Considerable
Shares in the Stock of your Petitioners (commonly called
South Sea Stock) and also of Annuities under your
Petitioners management, who are not described in the
Books of your Petitioners as married
That your Petitioners are advised that by the
Laws of this Kingdom upon the marriage of any Woman
so Intitled, her Husband thereby becomes Intitled to
such Share and may Transfer the same without the
presence or Consent of his Wife
That your Petitioners are frequently applied to
by Persons alledging themselves to be the Husbands of
the said Women requiring they may be permitted to
Transfer away in your Petitioners Books such Shares
without your Petitioners being able to discover with
reasonable certainty whether such allegations are
true to the great prejudice of public Credit
Your Petitioners therefore humbly Pray that
proper Directions may be given by act of
Parliament for the sufficiently proving the
Marriages of such Women intitled to any
such Shares as aforesaid, and for Registring
such Proofs in proper Books to be kept by your
Petitioners for that purpose before any Transfer
shall be made of the same after such marriage
so that your Petitioners may
By order of the Court of Directors
of the South Sea Company
