It being cenrently reported here that the Councer
Bannures (solong expected) was arrived at Paris from Spain with his
C Mr Resolutions in favour of the demands of the Atties of Hanover,
particularly, that We are to have fuell satisfaction for the depredations
comitted on us by his Subjects in the West Indies, That he will imediatel
cause the Offects by the Galleons to be delivered to the Proprietors, and
that the Flota is to depart this Sumer for Vera Cruz, It gives our Compy
the pleasing prospect that their many dependencies which have so
long lain in astagnating Condition, will now in good earnest be put
into Motion, and that by the reversal of those fedular which the
Company have so justly Complained of The Confinnation of such
favourable ones as they had obtained, and the procuring such other
Redulas as may be wanted, the Company may be Incouraged again to
Carry on the Trade
What I have now in Comand to acquaint you with is that
as it is a considerable time since the Company sent out four ships wt the
Supply of Negroes for Buenos Ayres, and they have not sent thither
any stores and necessary for that Factory for some years past, it is
absolutely necessary to send out the Store Ship for that place forthwith
And tho the Company understand that they have a Right to send out
this Ship in Virtue of the 34th Article of the Assiento on performing
the Conditions therein Stipulated, without asking previous leave of
the Court of Spain, yet as this is the first Ship since the late difference
it may be prudent to send with her his CMs Permission for that
purpose, The Court of directors do therefore desire you will not lose
a Moments time in procuring the necessary dispatches for her
Admission, and any other favourable orders you judge may be
ofuse with regard to the General Affairs of the Company at that
place, The Vessel is called the Assiento Gally John Ofie Master
Burthen about 150 Tons Spanish Tonage, As to the Stores and
Neccesarys
