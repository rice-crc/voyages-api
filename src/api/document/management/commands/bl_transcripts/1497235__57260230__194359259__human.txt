date the 23d Feb last on the Subject of the Royd Georges condemnation
And forbiding your alienating her property or disposing of her Store
fil further Orders which we hope came timely to your hands, having
now dispatchd Mr Elias Bird & Mr Nichd Hillwith 20 Shipwrights
experiened as Saylors with a quantity of Materials for repairing her
in Case they find her capable of it
Capt. Waring is arrived, and has delivered us your packet
of the 6th Jany last By which we observe you intended to send home the
ffruits by hired Vessels If that be not already done and the Royd George
comes home, it will furnish a good conoryance for them, and prevent that
expence
Andaw Your purpose of going to Barbadoes in Case of a
Warr, which probably you will have heard has been begun by the
Spaniard having actually besieged Gibraltar (of which S Charles
Wager has as We are Informd sent accounts to the West Indies by two
Men of Warr) We think you have nothing to do, but to make the best of
Your way home, There being not in our apprehension much difference
in point of Security, betweene Antiqun and Barbadoes, and We
knows of no great danger you have to apprehend at Sea; We indeed aply
to the Admiralty by way of over caution, for another convoy, but were
told it could not be ready within the time it was wanted, and we do not
desire of expect you should wait for any. And therefore upon receipt
of this You are to apply to Capt Garlington of the Kingsaly to make
the Cust of his way hoing. We are
