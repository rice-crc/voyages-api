tis to no purpose to Answer. What We are now to take Notice of is
Yor Detension at Sampeluna, and the privolous pretence on wch as
You write tis grounded. But it does not appear to us That you
insisted on the Coms. You have from his Majy wt was very fitt
for us to have known For the Spaniards Disregard to that
Comrs. cannot appear unless unless you pleaded it, Nor can We
properly Complain at our Court till the know You have so done
You will therefore forthwith Satisfy us in this point, that We
may apply in a proper Manner for your Releasement In
the mean while We hope the Cavil Treatment you meet wth at
Pampeluna will be continued It is also necessary that You send
us an Authentick Copy of the order for Yor being seized And this
You should have done when You first advisd us of it You will
therefore get from the Govr or otherwise such a Copy, & transmit
to us wth all Speed By Order of the Court of
Directors
