Dr. Stewart
your's of the 26th is come safe to hand & I acknowledge
with much thankfullness the oblidging Concern you
show for lr^d Carnarvons health, if the vistempter you
mention encreast in Oxford, I should endeed think
it very imprudent to remove him out of the university
but as no great City is at all times fice every past
fre from it & that his stay is not to he above a week
longer, I believe it will be better to let him stay
his letter and, where by he'l be able to take his leave
in a gox decent manner that his departure in a
Hurry will otherwise let him. I find by his Letter
to me he hath much exceeded the allowance, I made
him w^ch I cannot but be surprised at, when
I reflect how safe on one I made him, & hope that
for the future better Care will be taken. I desire
You'l draw upon me at ten days right for the sum
which will be wanting to enable him to leave the
University with reputation & you'l set forward sren-
thene upon the town He is to make in the Weil
which when you have finish You'l return with him to
Cannoy I approve very will the rout you sent me, except
as to hes going into Herefordsh: w^ch being a part of
England, if hope He'l have to see often thereafter (it is not
so necessary for some other reasons so pruden for him to
see at the time.
