for their own Profit, will Intitle the Company in all Events to a
demand under the Treaty for a suitable Reparation of Damages sustain'd
thereby, and we shall by this means have the Chance of getting away
more of the Comps effeets than We hazard afresh, which alone seems
worth making the Tryal of An Adventure to the Havana at this
Juncture, besides the Advantage in Comon with other Ports, may
likewise be attended with some probable good Effect towards the
Clearing & dispatch of the Prince Frederick from the constant
Correspondence there is between that Port and Vera Cruz, at which
latter should they hear the Company deeline sending any Negroes
to Havana, where a Bando is said to have been published for
their Admittance, it may be natural for the Spaniards to conceive
fresh Jealousies of some further Breach between the two Nations
from the Companys own Conduct
You will therefore on receipt hereof Dispatch a
Vessel qualified with such number of Negroes as you shall judge
proper for the Havana and Vera Cruz, where we have Factors
actually residing, in order to make a regular and proper Offer
on the Companys part of Opening the Assiento pursuant to the
Preliminaries, and according to the reception they shall meet wth
you will continue to supply them as you shall judge expedient
and according to what shall be found practicable in withdrawing
more Effects then are hazarded till the Times are better settled
We now write by the enclosed Letter to Mr Gibson
Dalzells who is arrived at Jamaica from St Jago de Cuba, and
having had that Factory under Consideration from past Experience
We are of Opinion, It is not worth the Companys while to continue
the constant residence of a Factor at that place, and therefore &
in regard that Mr Dabzells Covented time with the Company is

at Jamaica is an Expence to the Company without his being able
to do any service to them We have recalld him, and directed him
to take the first opportunity of Embarking for London, And
that he leave with you all original Books Autos Inventorys
other papers which he may have with him relating to the Compas
affairs that have been under his Care & Management, And as it
is fitting we should be felly Informd thereof We have likewise directed him
