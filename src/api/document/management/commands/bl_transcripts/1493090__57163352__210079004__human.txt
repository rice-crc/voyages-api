To deland whither heve ouldin iston this Pretenson In arnsen
to which He said he could not desist from it without orders
from his Court
Whereupon Mr Keene having at our Instances Romonstrated
against this Innovation He by Letter which we received the sd
of August last acquainted us that he had been assured by M
Latino the Spanish Minister that Sir Thomas Goraldins had
Oinformd him that he had desisted from his Pretension, and the
Court of Directors having the same day Cominicated Mr Kones Letter
to fir Thomas Teraldins observing to him that they had not been
made acquainted with his desisting hir Thomas thereupon declared
That about six weeks before he had received an order from M
Ratmo to Desist but that he had not imparted it to the Court of
Directors they not having made any application to him for that
purpose
We beg leave to take Notice that the Court of Directors
justly Conceiving this answer very Extraordinary, as they could
not dwine that Sir Thomas Geraldmo had received this order they
on the same day resolved to Call a General Court to Acquaint them
with this proceding and thereupon Sir Thomas Geralding the
next day delivered a Memorial to the Comittee of Correspondence to
the following Effect Vizt
That the King his Master had ordered him in Case the Company
had refolved to prepare the Annual Ship and Cargo, to wave
this Pretension for the present Toyage&
Having thus laid before your Majesty the several Incidents
relating to this affair, as we cannot but be of Opinion that the
Dispatch of our Annual Stip this Year has been rendred impet
treable by the Conduct of Sir Thomas Goraldins to our very great
Detriment, Wemost humbly pray Your Majestys Interpositiong
in relation to this New Greevance that we may thereby obtainy
Such Reliefas to your Majesty in your Royal Wisdom shall
appear most Suitables to so great an Injury received
By order of the General Court
of the South sea Company
