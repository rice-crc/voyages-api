Mr Drumond Dear Sir
I have rec^d by [Cob Compbell?] y^e fav^r.
of y^r. of y^e 15^th. Just N: S: & return you many thanks
for your oblidging Hint relating to our Affairs hereo.
I confess I don't apprehend any great danger & look
upon our S. S. Scheme to be so will Establish as to be
out of the reach of being next by any Attacks w^ch can
be made upon it. They intend to open a Subscription
tomorrow for a million at 300 to take in 3 Mill of y^3
redeemable Debts, upon w^ch they make a Profit of 2
Million w^ch alone w^d keep y^e Actions up to an higher
Rate than they are now at besides the Interest the Governm^t
pay for the 2 Mills becomes divideable upon y^e Capital
of 13^th w^ch still render y^e Actions more valuable.
There in such a demand for those Subscription, (of w^ch y^e
5th is sh^d down y^e other successively every two Months)
that had y^e Subscription been for two Millions, instead
of one it wou'd have fill^d d as easyly, the reason.
