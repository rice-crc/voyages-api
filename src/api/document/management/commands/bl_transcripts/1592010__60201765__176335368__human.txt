Sir
I send you enclosed the Plumbers Bill of
work done by Volomer w^.ch is the only Plumber
Bill I can find & am persuaded I gain
& would to you at Cannons unless M^r. Tort
had it afterwards & if so you'l find it amongst
the Bundle of Workans Bills I sent down. to
D^r. Barter, I spoke to M^r. [Lolicosre] about the
Servants Wages paid by Cap^r. Russell, they stand
charg'd in the Rentlal in one gross article &
he alwacis [always] told me the receipts were taken
all together in a Book for that purposeÂ 
& which I remember to have seen. He told
me they were alwacis [always] paid up only kept one
Quarter in[ Arrcan] M^r. [Lolicosre] will leave
amongst some paper & bouchers he [saicth]
the hath of Cap^r. Russells by him, to se what
he can find & will send them to you however
I should hope by examining the servants, they
would tell you truly how far they are paid
& what is still owning to them. I confess I
shall be very glad to see all these [alteccis]
once sett in a clear light & all the Bills paid.
I send you Red Hills Acco^t. of the strong
Beer spent in town & her letter. I am apt to
think there is no good understanding between
Jayce & him, but I see daily an altercation
