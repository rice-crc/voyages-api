had made for the Manner of [Huntshill?] &
that I should be glad to have it finished &
the conveyance prepaid for it as soon as
could be.
I have not yet rec^d an estimate of
the expence of putting the Castle into a good
& tenantable repair, as soon as this is done
I desire it may be [?] me up & this it is
too late to take it in hand this year
would however have it began upon early
the next, that it may be finish^d soon for y^r
living in if you like it.
Â I rec^d the Plan of the Castle street propos^d
to be built & like very well the design: I wish
You would heal with such as are willing to
build & let me know what [?] they desire
& what ground rents they'll pay
I return You many thanks for y^r offering
invitation of Me. to yr house in Case I had
come down this year to, Hereford next Summer

are in the Country will accept the offer you
made me, as in Servants & [?] shall the
