Sir,
We take this first opportunity of expressing to you the great
Satisfaction We have that the Affairs of the Assiento of Negroes are again
reestablished, as you will have observed by the Preliminary Articles & other
Acts which have been long since Circulated to the several Governments in the
Spanish America, This We should sooner have done had not the new settler
our Factory, who have the honour to deliver this to you, taken up so much
of our Time
We hope all differences are so adujsted as that no likelyhood
will be left of any future Interruption of our Comerce, and as We are assure
of your good Intentions to oblige the Company in what lies in your power
We take this occasion of assuring your Honl of our constant Esteem, and
that We shall be glad to have it in our power to do you any accptable senrees
The Gentlemen whom We have appointed ouer Factors for
Panama and Portobelo are Mr Richard Rigby President or Chief & Mr
Henry Johnson and Mr James Echlin We desire Sir Your Favour and
Friendship to them & the Royal Assiento Affairs under their Conduct & for
which We trust they will not do any thing to for feet their Claim to
We have thought it for His Catholick Majestys Service
as well as that of the Company to alter the former Negro Mark that at
your place being as We are informed by our late Factors in the Custodys
some other of the Royal Officers at your place, who upon ye late Seizure
of the Companys Concerns would not permit it to be broke as by other was
at Panama, We therefore desire that that old Mark may be forthwith be deliver'd
up to our present Factors, lest by any Accident it should fall into anry
private Hands, and an ill Use should be made of it to the prejudice of His
Catholick Majesty and the Company
We pray God to preserve you many Years being wth particular Respect
