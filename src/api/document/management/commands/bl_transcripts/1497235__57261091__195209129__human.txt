South Sea House Londons 14 Feby 1728
Messrs Rigby & Pratter
We wrote you the 15th November by the Radcliff Capt
Barefoot of which We sent Copy by our sloop St James and the Hanibal
Capt Turner, by which also we wrote you two Letters of the 20t of that Month
Copys enclosd) As these Ships carried the men & Stores designed for the Prince
Frederick We are impatient to hear of their being arrived & forwarded for
Vera Cruz Since our writing the aforesaid Letters, We have reced yours
of the 14t Septemrs 7th & 27th of October with ye Papers & Accot referr'd to
We have seen a Letter from Mr Collit dated in Carraccas
the 1st of Novemr last, Advising that he has not only been admitted at
that place in virtue of the Spanish Orders, but that those very orders were
Circulated from Carthagena, which convinces us that the Factors would
have been admitted at Carthagena had they gone & tendred themselves
after the Arrival of the orders, and are sensibly concernd to hear what
Encouragement is given to the private Traders, and that the Spanish
Governors even take upon themselves avowedly to grant Lincences for
Introducing Negroes, the Consequence of which will undoubtedly be
their opening Indultos in whatever parts they shall find most for
their Advantage, as we hear they have done at Carthagena, St Jago, &
Havanah, which must necessarily be very fatal to the Comps Trade
And as the Governrs may plead in Excuse for this proceeding the necessity
of the Spaniards for these Introductions, and Impute that necessity to
Companys not supplying thems, and in regard that Mr Collits
reception in one of the Spanish Ports, whilst no actual refusal
of our Factors can properly be said to have been made at any, it may be
a further Justification of the Conduct of the Spaniards in respect to the
Preliminary Articles, therefore to put astop to their pretended
necessity for Introducing and Indulting Negroes We think it
Imports us to repossess our selves of the Assiento Trade as soon
as possible, which may be done for the present by sending to Havana
and Vera Cruz where We have Factors, a few Negroes as from the
advices you may have received you judge proper, which will
at the same time satisfy the Spaniards of our Trust in ye Preliminaries
and readiness to supply the Contract which if it does not put after
to what seems now to be the same playing by the Spanish Governor
