they prevail upon the Dean of the said Church to deliver him
up, nor obtain a Sentence from the said Govenors or Officers for
that purpose, as may appear by the Proofs in the Companys custody
ready to be produced
3d. To the third Head of Complaint, which was of Spains danying the
Companys Right to grant Licences for Sale of Negroes in such
parts of the Spanish West Indies as could not bear the Charges of
a Factory, It being answered, that his Catholick Majesty's orders
on this Point are no more than a Repettion of the 8th Article of
the Assiento Treaty, by which it is provided that the Negroes
shall only be introduced at such Ports and places where a Royal
officers or their deputys reside; The Company beg leave to Reply
That this in no wise answers the Import of their Complaint, as
it never was attempted to Introduce nor even pretended by the
Company that they or their Licencees might introduce Negroes
into any place where there were no Royal Officers or their Deputys
Resident, and therefore as no such unlawful Introduction was
ever designed, the orders of his Catholick Majesty and 8th Article
of the Assiento, which they are in the said Answer mentioned
to be a repetition of are entirely out of the Case. The Hardship
complained of here is that the Companys Right of granting
Lycences for Introducing Negroes in places where there are
Royal officers or their Deputys has been and is opposed by Spain
Although such Right has been till of late enjoyed by the
Company who was entitled thereto as it was a Right granted
to and exercised by former Assientists, and therefore ought to
be equally enjoyed by the Company, as by the 39th & 42d Articles
