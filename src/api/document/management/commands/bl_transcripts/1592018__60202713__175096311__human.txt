the Munckall is very true & your observation
just. & confess I think it w.^d have been more
prudent to have pull’d down at once all
put unnecessary large old Buildings & have
built what was past fit & convenient for
a Tenant. I am very willing to put y^e
into at good Repair as need be for a succeeding
Tent who you'l take care shall keep it up
so: nor did intend to intimate by w^ch wrote
in my last y^e I was any ways [dissatisified?]
w^.th your Care of these Concerns: of w^.ch I am
persuaded you take as much as the Nature
I had quick ?
of them will admit.        
forget y^e Key of my Fathers Closset was left in
y^r. Custody else I sh^.d: not have given directions for
y^e breaking it open. The Boxes & Trucks of Papers
& writings I w^d have sent up to Canons I believe
they must come by y^e Way of London. Mr Lane
has not sent Me the Schedule of the Books &
The House Furniture & y^e
Pamphlets.
[Skim?] I w^d likewise have you had up to Me
As for the Bording Pieces Pistol y^e 2 [Secutory?]
[Prefer?] & y^e 2 Trucks you speak of, they are at
Mr Lanes & y^.r services. And you may divide
The Acc^t?
them as you speak together
of Goods left at Dewfall when my Father went
to Turkey you may take & I shall be very glad
if by y^t. means you can punish Mr [Elfe?] for his
Behaviour, who deserves no favour at my hands.
