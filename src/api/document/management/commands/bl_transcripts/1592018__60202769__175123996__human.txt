Dear Captain:
I have given your Acco^t. to M^r. Gray to be
examined & will send you as soon as this is done a
Bill for the Money. pray return my hearty thank,
to Mr. Powell of Castlemaddock for his friendship in
communicating to me the gross neglect of my Agent
in Radnorsh: in not taking due care to secure for me
the Herriott due upon the Death of M^r Vaughan.
I know very little of M^r. Pyes concerns, He
hath paid me off & taken up 28000£ upon his Estate
at 4pC He proposes with the Surplus to Stock
Gobb & to get enough to recover his whole Estate but I
doubt He'l find himself mistaken, when tis too late.
you Sent me up once a State of what is to be deducted
out of the rent due to him for Taxes & I have mislaid
that paper & desire you to send me Such another
including the last payments made for the Landtax &
the Sooner you send me this the better because I only
wait for this accot. to settle with him & to pay him off
Mr Vaughans Estate of Madly was offer'd to me, but
it lying so convenient for my Coz: Bridges of Tiberton,
I was very willing He should have it & accordingly as
I understand He intends to buy it I think it was M^r
Woodhouse who mention'd it to me, but am not Sure
I am &  
from.
