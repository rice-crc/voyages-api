Extract from a Letter written by the Court of Directors
of the South Sea Company to Mr Bowles their agent in
Madrid the 26th June 1718
We have reced yo of the 20th Cunt. with the Tranilation of the Mary Grane
o Letter to Mr Stanhope complaining of Our Sending 2 ships in Company with Our
Annl ship to vera Cruz. And the find the stress of the Complaint in the said Letter
is that our design of our sending 2 ships with the Annual one was that they might
carry all the Provisions & Stores, whereby the other might be enabled to carry
her entire Lading of Merchandize. But seeing this was not the Case We
think it very proper for our Justification that you set this matter in a true light
that the court of Spain maybe convinced of the Integrity of the Companys Proceedings
And that no fraud was intended as the said Letter Suggests.
The True case is this. The company's Annual ship Royal Prince
bound to vera cruz having onboard a very rich and valuable Cargoe wherein so many
Proprietors were interested as well as his CM: The Court of Directors did not
think it Prudent or safe to Suffer her to Proceed the voyage without Convoy.
Seeing the pyrates were then become so very numerous and formidable in these
Parts, having taken the Whidah an English ship of 24 Guns & 80 men richly
laden. Also the Dragon & Royal Africa belonging to the Company the
first
