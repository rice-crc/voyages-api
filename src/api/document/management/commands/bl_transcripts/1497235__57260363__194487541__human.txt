London 16 May 1728
Sir
Inclosed is Copy of what our Sub Depty Governs wrote you
the 9th Inst. We are now to observe to you That altho the Copys you
sent us in your Letter of the 3d Inst of the King of Spain's Orders to the
Duce Roys of Seru & New Spain gave us some Satisfaction on the first
perusal of them Yet upon a more Close and considerate review, We aprehen
them to be very loose and insufficient, and Searcely to be Construed even here
much less in the Indies, to Import the delivery and restitution of all
the Company's Ships Vessells & Effects in the Indies, and that even
Doubts may arise with regard to the p Frederick and her Cargo wc
are Ordered to be restored, We have therefore made the following Remarks upon
the whole by which you may judge whether those Orders Sufficiently
odirect what ought to be and the Company hope is meant & intended by
them, Vizt The Delivery & Restitution, not only of the P Frederick
its Cargo or produce, but of all other Asso Vessells & Effects whatever
in the Several pots of the Indies
1st I Having Seen a Copy of the Orders which were sent to the
Vice Roy of New Spain for suring the Company's Ships and Efects
in that Kingdom, We observe they were by way of Cidulas Signed by
the King of Spain himself and Countersigned by Dr Joseph Latime
drawn in all the forms requisite to make them Authentick positive
& Effectual Notwithstanding which when the advices of the Cissation
of hostillitys in Europes arrived in those parts, upon application
made to the Vic Roy by the Company's Agents for discontinuing the
Reprisalia It was formerly resolves, That as the reprisalia had
been executed by positive Orders from the King of Spain the Same
could not be taken off again untill express Orders should arrive from
his CMttle of equal Authority with the first, which Comanded the
Embargo, Whereas the present Orders for the restitution appear to
us to be sign'd by Mr Patino only, which the hicRoys may
probably
