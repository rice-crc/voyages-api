the Mississippi Actions will not rise much higher,
I am confirm^d in mine, y^t the best Course I can
take will be to dispose of those I have &
accordingly repeat my request to you, to sell
them, & keep the Effects by you, till a favour=
=able Exchange comes to remit it over. I sh^d [should]
be glad to see the Exchange at 50^d 10 ^s wou'd
make me a considerable gainer. I desire
you will please to let Me know in whose Name
You will have the 3000 Affrican Stork subscribed,
at present it is in my own, & I have made
the first Paym^t. but I shou'd be glad you'd
send Me over some other name to place it in,
to whom I wou'd likewise pay the residue of
the 500. I am in your Debt. I am sorry I
cou'd not get the whole 5000 for you subscribed
as I first proposed, & hoped to have effected
but the Number of Subscribers, above w^t[what] the Fund
w^d [would] bear was so great the Necessity obliged a
great Defaliation to be made from the whole.
All I cou'd do was to prevail to have you more
favourably used than most others were; In
every thing wherein I can be upfull to you,
you may depend upon my receiving w^th great
Pleasure your Comands, there being no Body
who is more sincerely than my self
Dear Sir
