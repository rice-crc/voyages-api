Dr. Maj.
Yours of the 14th Inst. come to hand; & I apprive
very well of the Agreement you have made with
Mr. Mee, Vendeed better, than the former, for I had
much rather hav the Estate & ii thonut the incum-
=brance of the Annuity, than with it, but as I take
Mr. Trige to have rated that Annuity but at 1000 £
I presume I am to pay, but 8550£ however &
very readily agree to be determind by what Mr
ingy sap upon that prinh, the Parchaie mone
shall be paid assoon as the writings are
executed; wch I suppowe nill not take up much
time & the Sooner Mr. James Kings them up
I have heard no thing of Ld Ducys
