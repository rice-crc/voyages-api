Capt. Jones Mr Halsey
Mr Brooke
Mr Gambier having perused and Approved the Draft of
the Indenture of Covenants between the Company and the Panama
and Portobelo Factors, the same was laid before the Comittee
Mr. Gambier having Observd to the Comittee, That the
Surgeons Bookheeper and Witers being only approvd by the Compy
and not directly in their Service, there should be Bonds with Special
recitals conditioned for their faithfull accounting for and de=
=livering up any Effects of the Comp. which in case of Decease or
absence of all the Factors at Panama or Portobelo may come to
their hands, the Comittee gave directions for preparing the Deaft
of Such a Bond accordingly to be Entred into by the Book heeper
and Wiiters, and are of Opinion that as the surgeous are immedi-
-ately in the Service of the Factors, and are to be paid by them,
there's no Occasion for any Articles between the Comp aned them
and therefore that the Articles, which Mr Innes has Executed wth
the Company be Cancelled.
