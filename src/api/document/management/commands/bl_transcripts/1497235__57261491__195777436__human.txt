Gentlemen
We take this opportunity of expressing to you the great
Satisfaction We have that the affairs of the Assiento of Negroes are again reestablish'd
as you will have observed by the Preliminary Articles and other Acts which
have been long since firculated to the several Governments in the Spanish
America, this We should sooner have done had not the new settling our
Factory who have the pleasure to deliver this to you taken up so much of ou
Time
We hope all Differences are also adjusted as that no likelyhood
will be left of any future Interruption of our Comorce, and as we are assure
of your good Intentions to Oblige the Company in what lies in yor power
We take this occasion of assuring you of our constant Esteem, and that
We shall be glad to have it in our power to do you any acceptable Services
The Gentlemen whom We have appointed our Factors for
Panama & Portobelo are Mr Richard Rigby President or Chief & Mr
Henry Johnson, & Mr James Echlin We desire Gent your Favour
and Friendship to them, and the Royal Assiento Affairs under their
Conduct & Care, which we Trust they will not do any thing to forfeit
Their Claim to
We have thought it for His CMs serviceÂ  as well as that of
the Company to alter the former Negro Mark, that at your place being
as We are informed by our late Factors, now in the Custody of some or one
of you for that upon the late Seizure of the Companys Concerns it was
not permitted to be broke as the other was at Panama, We therefore desire
That that old mark may be forthwith deliverd up to oue present Factors
Lest by any Accident it should fall into any private hands, and an ill
Use should be made of it to the prejudice of His CM and the Company
We pray God to preserve you many Years, being
London
