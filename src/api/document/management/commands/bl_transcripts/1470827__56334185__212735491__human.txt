and produced Several Lotters which he left with the Comittee from
Mr Hitchinson from Porto belo after the Captain left that place wc
were read, and produced by the Captain, as some Evidence of the Injus-
tice of the Charge, because Mr Hutchinson being said to be conceind
in the Contract to Uriede it would have been natural for him to have
mentioned Something of it in one or other of those Letters, which take
no notice of any thing of it.
He produced likewise a Copy of a Lotter from Dr. Cirionte
Lee Flores to Mr Mira, the Original of which he (Mr Mira) was willing
should be Shewn to the Comittee which lays a Severe Charge upon
Mr Swark and Johnson, so that the whole Considerd, It seems to this
Comittee that lither this Complaint and those formerly made by
Bullee, and the other Factors against Mr Swartz, proceed from Irrecon-
=cileable Malice against Each other, or else they have been all culpa=
ble, and Seem to cover their particular Faults by accusing the rest
and therefore that the Court may be fully Infoumnd of the Truth of these
Facts, The Comittee are of Opinion that the Factory be wrote to upon
this matter, and that Capt. Denniss the non Chief there, be requi
tred to send home the most Authentick proof he can procure of the
Teuth or Falsity of the whole, That the Court may be able to form
a right Judgment herein, And that the Copys of the Several Complaints
be Sent over to him
