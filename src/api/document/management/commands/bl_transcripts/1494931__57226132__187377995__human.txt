to the 20th April last being 1600 in Number which you Set at Different prices
in Parcells of 200, 300 at 230 a 240 $ some at 250 a 300 and Some Single Ones
at 320 which last you tell Us is the highest Price any Negro has been
sold for in the Indies whereas We are will Assured the Portuguese Generaly
sold at 4 @ 500 $ as did lekewise the French at the beginning of their Assiento
And even the latter end (when the Illicit Introductions began to take place
from that Companys not being Able to supply them) 300 $ was Reckoned a Low
price However We Recomend to you to do the best you can and Encourage
the Selling in Parcells, which will prevent the Charges and Mortality
of keeping And if you find it most for Our Interest to abate Something
in quick Sales and Large Parcells as you have Recomended We give
leave so as it be done with prudence and at Such Junctures of Time as
may make it Necessary But We hope in a Little Time by Good Management
of the Negro Trade the price may be broughtup to what they were formerly
We have taken Notice of Your Complaints of Twoo Cargoes of Negroes
of the Don Carlos and Prince of Asturias But as We have received from
Jamaica Depositions upon Oath of the Goodness of these Two Parcells even
beyond others which if true as We can not doubt the Contrary gives Us
strong proofs of Your Insincerity And that the Dismal Account you
give of them is only a plausible Reason for Your Selling or pretending
to sell them at such Notorious low prices as 200 & 215 $ and a 12 Months Credit
