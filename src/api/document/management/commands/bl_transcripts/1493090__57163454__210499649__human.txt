Company are at the whole Charge of Carrying on both Branches
and the King of Spain is engaged by the 22th Article to make
good to them his Share of the Losses which may happen in
the Losing Article, that of the Negro Trade, which it is but
just should be answered out of his Share in the profitable
Branch, And this seems to have been so understood on the
part of Spain in regard that althought former Annual
Ships of this Company had before the year 1730 made
successful Voyages to the Spanish West Indies and brought
home considerable Profit, yet no demand was ever made
on the part of Spain for his Catholick Majestys share of
those profits Independant of the other Accounts relating to
the Negro Trade until the desire made of the Profits of
the Prince William, which the Company to shew their
readiness to oblige the Court of Spain did for that time
agree to Comply with, and which Compliance is now
Set up by Spain as a precedent for making the like
Demand on every such occasion, And the Company
think they have the stronger Reason not to comply with
that demand in regard of the great Sums of Money now
resting due from Spain to the Company on account of their
Effects seized in the Spanish West Indies, which they have
not yet received Satisfaction for, and to which They insist
they are in Justice entitled, previous to and independant
of all other Accounts whatsoever, more especially as a very
great part of the Effects so seized, have long since actually
come into his Catholick Majestys Coffers in old Spain
