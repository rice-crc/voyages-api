I have been [deni'd] by so many of my
Friends to intercede with you in behalf of Mr.
G. Harris Supervisor of Excise in [A ber gavenny]
that I could not avoid giving you this trouble.
I take the liberty therefore to assure you
that from all the accounts, I have had
of him, he is esteem'd a man of a General
good Character; & if he is able in the Excise
business (of w^:ch you S^r. are the best judge) as he
is represented to be, I should hope, his numerous
family & lowness of his Circumstances, may
move your Compassion towards him, & encline
you to forgive small failings when there is [a]
prospect of their being amended. I beg leave
to entreat your favour in his behalf, w.^ch will
be a great Instance of your Friendship to
S^r &c
