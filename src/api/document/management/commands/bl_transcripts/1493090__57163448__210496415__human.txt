2dly That the King of Spain was to be entitled to receive his
Share of the Profits of the Annual Ship in the like Manner
as he was to receive his Share of the Profits, if any, made
by the Negro Trade, And therefore that the Accounts ought to
be made up in like Manner in both Branches of Trade, that
is at the end of every five years, as is settled concerning the
Negro Trade Accounts by the 29th Article of the Assiento Treaty
How else can the Annual Ships Profits be said to be enjoy'd
by the King of Spain in like Manner as in the Assiento
cannot in Justice be cited as a precedent, that therefore the
Single Question is Whether this demand of imediate payment
of the said Profits by Spain is sounded, as is asserted by the
above Answer of M Patino in all respects agreeable to the
Treatys and to the Articles of the Assiento This the Company
beg leave to deny by appealing to the Assiento Treaty wch
is the only one they know of that relates to this Question
Now by the last or additional Article of the Assiento Treaty
by which the Annual Ship is, in consideration of the Losses
suffered by former Assientists, granted to the present, and
which is the only article in which the Annual Ship
is mentioned, It is expressly stipulated that his Catholick
Majesty is to enjoy or partake of a Quarter part of the
Profits of the said Ship in like Manner as in the Assiento or
Negro Trade Whereby it appears as they apprehend
1st That this Grant of the Annual Step is made as a sort of
recompence for the Losses the Assientists might sustain as the
former ones had, and that Spain evidently looked upon the
Annual Ship as the profitable Branch and upon the Negro
Trade as the Losing one
3dly That this last article being the only one which takes
Notice
