should give proper orders for payment thereof out of his
first Royal Revenues in old Spain so as that such deficiency
might be effectually discharged within three Months from
the Time of such application, and lastly that in failure
of payment in old Spain within the time above limitted

of the continuance of the present Term of the Assiento
according to the Treaty was to be for thirty Trading years, and
that such years wherein the Companys Trade was obstructed
should not be taken into the Account, as by the said
Explanatory Plan, a Copy of which is hereto annexed,

The above mentioned Plan with its Explanation having
been severally agreed to by General Courts of this Company
the same were laid before our Sovereign together with an
humble Address that his Majesty would be graciously
pleased
