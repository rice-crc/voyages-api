for facilitating the same is a Grace done them,
But as it seems by this Explanation that
now of these Negroes can be Sent up till 6
Mos after their Arrival in the port, it will be
for Use; For the Compa can never pretend to
keep Negroes on hand so long a time and his
remedy would be as bad as the Disease they
therefore hope it will be explained in such
that there must first of all be a Legal
Manner as to be renderd practicable in
Execution, And that they may have a general
liberty with the Governors Leave to send up
what they cant sell in Buenos Ayres in less
time than the 6 Mos, the Compa are well assurd
that City & the part adjacent will not take
off 100 Negroes Annually
unsold, may be imported within land
as far as Chili, with the 400 Stipulated
for that purpose in the Assiento, and
a Cedula to be dispatched with that
permission, but therein to be provided,
that there must first of all be a Legal
proof of that the whole 800 Negroes could
to not be sold in Buenos Ayres, and a time
shall be given for Persons to resort
from other parts to the purchasing
thereof, for which the term of Six
Months shall be assigned them, to
comence from the Day of their Arrival
at Buenos Ayres, and each shall
carry two or three Persons who shall
make no longer stay in those provinces
than the time necessary for the Sale
of the Negroes, and the recovering of
their produce, and they shall not settle
Factorys for this purpose. This they
shall oblige themselves to, as also to
the returning afterwards to Buenos
Ayres, and presenting themselves there
before the Governour & Royal Officers
and the Space of one Year is appointed
