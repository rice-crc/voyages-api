As to the Restitution Corulay It may be right as Mr
Patins observes to separate them into two distinet Cesulas, one relative
to the Imbargo Anno 1718, and the other to the present, That for the
first We think should recite the former edula which was Issued in
pursuance of the Treaty between Great Britain and Spains made in
the Year 1721 and should strongly enforce the Execution of it so far as
it has not been Comply'd with and if words could be found out to compel
the Governors or other Spanish officers to quit their old pretence that

expect no good Effeet from it, but to have the very same treatment
overagain

We hope heis fincery in saying He would be answerable for the
Restitution of what had been seized by his orders, for We
would not suppose hum to equivocate tho the orders for Seizin,
were by way of Cedulasign'd by the R. of Spain) and his fettlin

was no restriction or private orders sent contrary to the Genl orders
of Restitution dispatchd after signing the Preliminarie, but this
