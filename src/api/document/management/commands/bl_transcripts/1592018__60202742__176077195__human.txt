Dear Son
of Carnarvon
I am very glad to hear by a Ltre last
post fr.^o M^r. Hunt of your being got safe to york,
where I hope your stay will be long enough for you
to see every thing thereabouts worth your enquiring
after. I was much concern'd to find by y.^e publick
Papers you had been in such Danger from y^e misfortune
w.^ch happen'd to you by y.^r fall from y.^r Horse as you
were crossing the Ford going to Lord Northampton's.
Indeed I did not give any Credit to it, till it was con=
=firm'd by a Chaplain of My L.^d Sussex's just come
up to Town & cannot but much wonder M^r. Hunt
has taken no notice of it to me, which I think he ought
to have done had it been only out of justice to those
who, as I hear, leapt into the River to take you out.
Pray let me have an Acc.^t how this accident was.
I wish you a pleasant continuance of y.^r Town
& a safe return to y.^r Studies at Oxford. Y.^r Mother
joins w.^th me in fonding our Blessings to y.^r self &
Brother. We are both very glad to hear he bears
travelling so well.
I am &c
My humble service to the Gentlemen w.^th you.
