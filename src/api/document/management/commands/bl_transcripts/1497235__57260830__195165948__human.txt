any ship of Sufficient Burthon, Qualifying the same with Negroes and to
consign them by Bill of Lading to Capt Williams or the Comander of the
P. Frederick for the time being, and in the absence of the ship to our
Supra Cargoes Sending therewith an Invoice that they may appear
to Come directly from Jamaica and not from England Having on our
Application at Madrid for the admission of a Store Ship from England
to Vera Cruz, been refus'd and are by that Court, put upon this Method
of sending them Via Jamaica on Negroe Vessels, which prohae Vice
We have aquies'd in, rather than at this Juncture to dispute our right
to Store Ships
The Court of Spain give this reason for refusing the desired
Store Ships from England That the Apprehension of her carrying our
Merchandize, will discourage the Merchants from loading on the Flota
Ddesign'd next year, which however absurd they Cannot be Satisfyed of
the Contrary, as their Sealousies of Contraventions to the Treaty are
great, We give you in Charge to be particularly Carefull that no doy Goods
o Merchandize, or any thing but the Companys Stores, be pot on board the
Ship that shall Carry them
We are also about dispatching our other Sloop St James who
will carry some men, and Intend Capt John Cleland Shall Comand her
to Jamaica and then deliver her up to Capt Hearne, who We suppose
is Still with you waiting her arrival and Capt Cleland is to procede
as Opportunity offers for Oera Coue We having reinstated him in his
Comand of the Prince of Asturies, which We hope he will find arriv'ed
there with the Prince Frederick from Havana, where We understand
by Lrs from Mr Nicholson they were the 4th June last, and the next
day were to Sail for Vera Cruz
Inclos'd are our packetts for the Supra Cargoes and the Vera
Cruz Factory, which you will forward by the first Sloop or Vessel
that goes thither, We hope and are assured the Orders for Opening the
Trade will be of sufficient Authority with the Spanish officers, for
admitting the men stores &c wthout which the Sd. Frederick could
not come home, and Consequently that part of the Preliminary Articles
would be uncomply'd with on the part of Spain
Herewith we send you Copy of Capt Urings Instructions
for your Government, by which you will observe his Sloop is to be
Comploy'd
