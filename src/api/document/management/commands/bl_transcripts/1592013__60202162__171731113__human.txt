Self; the Subscription having been full, before I had
determin'd to be concern'd in it but upon Discoursing
with the Gentleman who have more particularly the
Charge of this Affair. If I can be Serviceable to your
Grace
and prevail to have the Subscription you desire taken
in, I entreat You will believe Ishall esteem it a peculier
Piece of good Fortune to have contributed to your
Satisfaction, there being nobody who is with greater
Respect Madam
