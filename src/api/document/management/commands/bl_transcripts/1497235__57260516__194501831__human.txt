know as the Company does, That during this Suspension of the Assiento
Trade great Importations are Clandestinely carryd to the Spanish
Coast In damage to the King of Spain as well as the Company
which will Continue till the Company can be enabled by the Revocation
of that Cedula to Introduce them as heretofore
The Court has Since their last Letter reed Yours of the 19th
20th July N D) whereby They perceive your application for Restitut
of the Snow Don Lewis & Tobacco at Portpassage has been fruisles
and that you are put off till tis Seen what had been done in the
Indies upon the Orders for the Reprisalia, and that you had assurances
made You that as those Orders were given not to employ the Effects to
the Kings or any other use, but that they were to remain as in Deposito
The whole would Certainly on the late Orders of Restitution be made
good to the Company, An Event they will be glad to find, because they have
Entertaind some Doubts of their being sufficiently Efcctual
But as We find our Ministers at the Congress as well as you
Self think it not prudent to push for any more Authentick Orders of
Restitution at present till they see that those Sent are not sufficient
They are Content to wait under their fearfull hopes, As it cannot now
be much longer before they hear the Issue
But they must Remark, That notwith standing the Order
were given, as Mr Patino Says for their Effects remaining in Deposits
He sees evidently they are broken in the two Instances of the Snow
Don Lewis, and the Tobacs as well as in that of the Ship Poince
Frederick now Actually in the King's Service, and they heartily
wish they may not be broken in Others.
It is therefore amazing to the Court of Directors That but
Frivolous delays, of Restitution of these Concerns so indisputably
belonging to the Company, are made, which Cannot but mncrease
their fears of a Non Complyance in the Orders given abroad
I am
Sir
Your most Obedient Servan
