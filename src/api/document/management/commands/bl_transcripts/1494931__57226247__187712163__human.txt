As to the Matter of Liberty of delivering Such License
Negroes as shall happen to be left unsold on the Windward Coast to an
of the Factorys at 125 $ p Ps of India, That was a Convenience on
Indulgence given only to such as had Liberty by their License to carry
fruits to other Ports and for wch they paid a higher Indult & which
the Lycensees without such Liberty are not intitled to & therefore Capt
Collet cannot of right demand any allowance for the Negro which he
could not sell, but brought back to Jamaica, altho, as his was the
first License issued before the Spaniards on that Coast had Expectation
of any Assiento Vessel from Jamaica he may have made but litte
Advantage of his Voyage and as he has done us good Service with
regard to the Execution of the Instructions You gave him concerning
our Effects in those parts and the illicit Trade carried on there and
particularly by Sisson & others & their pretended Substitutes of
Agents & the proper Methods for suppressing the same to wch end he
has already So much Contributed by giving the necessary Cautions to
the Spanish Govr. and in other respects has acquited himself with
Zeal & Attention for the Honour & Interest of the Company We leave it
to You to Settle with him any Dependance of that Voyage in Such
Manner as You judge reasonable, being unwvilling to insist upon any
thing that should be a real Discouragement to him But Licenses
are not to expect in future that we shall easily come into after reckoning
for thus, there would be no end, nor Certainty in this Busines
Te Note Capt. Collets bringing back a Certifcate of his
having paid the K of Spains Duty for the Negro he brought back
