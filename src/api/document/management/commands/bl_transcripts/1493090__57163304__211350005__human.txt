forbad the said Governor to give his Assent to any Law imposing
Dutys on Negro Slaves Imported into Jamaica payable by
the Importer, or upon any Slaves Exported that had not
been sold in the Island and continued there for the spaces of
twelve Months
That about the time this Instruction was given an Act passed
in Jamaica imposing a Duty on the Import & Export of Negroes
against which your Petitioners and many other Traders to
Guinea applied for Relief, and the Council and Assembly
of the said Island sent over a Representation to yor Majesty
praying in Consideration of the distresses of the said Island
therein fully set out that your Majesty would Confirm the
said Act and Revoke the said late Instruction of the 10th
of December 1731. Which Representation and also the
Memorials of the partys opposing what was pray'd thereby
and what Proofs or Reasons could be offered on both sides being
fully heard and considered first before the Lords Comissioners for
Trade and Plantations and afterwards before the Lords of the
Committee of your Majestys Council for Plantation affairs to whom
the same were referr'd, Your Majesty on hearing the Report
made on such References, was pleased on the day of October
1732 to disallow the said last mention'd Act and to direct
a strict observance for the futures of the said Instruction of the
10 Decemr. 1731
Since the making the said order several Acts have passed
for laying Dutys on Negroes Imported to be paid by the
Purchasers
