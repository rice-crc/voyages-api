Consequence if they are not timely Supplyd, this will also be the Safest
and quickest way of transmitting thither the packet you sent us of his
CMs order Mr Orders to the Govern there for opening the Trade, Restitution &
which Imports the Compa Should be sent away as soon as possible
As to the Stores from Jamaica which the Marqs de Paz Seems
to be So Sanguine that We may send them by Negroe Ships, you will
give me leave to remark to you fand which you will make such use
of as you see proper) that the 34th Art of the Assiento Seems expressly
to prohibit it, and is what the Marqs Seems not to have been aware
of and there's the Greatest Presumption the stores from Jamaica
will not be admitted at Vera Cruz by the Negroe Vessels, without some
Special Cedula or Order for that purpose For at present We have no Autho
rity at all to Send with these Stores, not so much as the Marqs Original Lre
to your Self, We are therefore waiting with Impatience for the Cedula
or other Authentick Order from the Court of Spain in this behalf Iam
