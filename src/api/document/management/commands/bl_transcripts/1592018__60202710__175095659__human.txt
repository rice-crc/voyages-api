Sir
Drumond
Since I wrote my Ltre [Letter] which went by
Yesterday's Post, I have rec^d. y^e fav^r. of y^rs of y^e 
3o^th.  & am very glad to find you have not disposed
of my Actions at 1800. Tho tis very true I did tell
My Lord Strafford I intended to write to you to that
Effect: but finding there is a probability of the
Stocks arising, I am enclined to let them continue
till they come to 2000, & then I shall be glad to have
them converted into Bank Bills w^ch you'l please to
keep by you till a proper Exchange comes & w^ch I
think cannot fail if the Diminution of the species
goes on, in a few Month of being at 50.
M^r Hunter has not yet sent Me the
Volumes of the [Arrets] You are pleas'd to mention
I presume he is not come over. I return you many
Thanks for these & all your other Favours for w^ch I
shall ever remain. - &c

am confident your Goodness in countenancing this
Undertaking will to the Companys.
I am w^th great Respect        &c
