And whereas it may be pretended that the King of Spains
Dutys for Negroes Indulted and Seized are payable in the Indies, which
We are inform'd is contrary to the practice of former Assientists, whose
Indulted and Seized Negroes were comprehended in the number they
were obliged to furnish, and the Dutys for those Negroes were paya
ble in like manner as for the rest Now for as much as this
Company are by the 39th & 42d Articles of the Assiento entitled to
all the Priviledges appertaining to former Assientists, You are as
much as possible to avoid paying dutys for the Negroes Indulted
or Seized, in as much as it would be a double payment, feeing the
Company pay for the full Compliment at Madrid But should
you be obliged thereto You are to send us Receipts or other Proofs
for what you shall so pay, that We may get the Money deducted
out of the Negro dutys at Madrid
And whereas it is not unlikely that it may be
pretended that our Assiento and the several Cedulas for suppressing
Clandestine Introductions of Negroes were suspended by the late
Difference between the Crowns of Great Britain and Spain, and that
therefore the Company have not a power to Seize or Confiscate the
Negroes Introduced during that interval, You are to insist that
that Suspension did not Warrant any others to Introduce Negroes
and it having for several months been taken off by the Prelimeny
Articles and other dispatches transmitted by the Court of Spain to
the several Governments in the Indies, our Assiento and Cedulas
are again infull force, and sufficient to enable you to Confiscate
as well what Negroes have been illicitly Introduced during the
Suspension as before and since, and could it be supposed otherwise
it would render impracticable all future Seizures, it being difficult
if not impossible to distinguish the Negroes Introduced before or during
the Suspension from those Introduced afterwards, But should any
difficulties arise inrelation hereto that you cannot surmount even
with
