"the Nature of a Confianza is such, that only two Persons should be
privey to what passes, and neither of them are to divulge it, on any
Consideration, that if the Companys Agent either at Madrid, or in
the Indies, should be under a Neccesity to Conclude any Negotiation
in Confianza, for a Consideration given, he is not at liberty to
Communicate to his Imployers, to whom the Consideration was given,
neither to State it in such a manner as it may be known, for many
Affairs of Importance have been happity Concluded al Madrid,
and in the Indies, with Persons of Character in Confianza between
two, which would not have been done, had a third Person been
Concern'd; for it does not always depend in Offering a Sum of
Money for a particular Indulgence
The Query is: Whether the Person who Offer the Gratuity, is a Man
of Abilities and Integrity, that what ever may be
Communicated, and transacted with him, will be
buried in Oblivion.
