computing the Bales. Barrells, Casks & Cases at the measurement of 2
Malaga or Canary Pipes to the tun, and the Tron and other Hintalage
Goods at 20 Ow. English to the tn so that this Company are at a Loss to
conceive by what Rule of measurement twas possible for the Governour
and Royal Officers at Carthagena to proceed in computing the said Cargoe
to amount to 2117 1/2 Tuns there not being any shy in his Britaunick
Majesty's Dominious nor as the Company beleive in the whole world
capable of carrying so great a Quantity of Goods and Merchandize as
227Â½h Tuns, and the ship Bedford on Board which their Merchandizes
were Loaded, in the measure of the whole burthen doth not exceed 1073
Tuns 55 parts of a tin. as appears by a Certificate under the hands of
the Comiss. of his Britannick majestys navy, which te herearth-
likewise transmit to your Majesty, and it is well known that the shipso
War being built more for Sailing than Burthen cannot carry so many
Tuns of Goods & Merchandize by a great deal as the ship is measured at,
and when it is considered that the ship Bedford had not a small Vessel
to attend her as is usual for men of War of her Burthen, so that she
was obliged to carry her whole Stores; Anchors Cables Water and whole
years Provisions &c from England, Allowance Being made for the stowage
thereof and for the Quantity of Goods which such a ship is able to carry
less than the Tunage she is measured at. It will be easly conceived
that the ship Bedford was not capable of carrying more than 600 kins
of Goods & Merchandize computed as aforesaid
And the Company Could not but apprehend that it was Your Majety
Gracious Intentions that the tunage of their Goods should be computed as
is aforesaid for that the Company did in a memorial delivered to his
Excelly the marquis of Monteleon: Your Majesty's ambassador at thes
Court dated the 16th of December 1714 (among other things represent)
That they being desireous on all occasions to shew the Justice and
Integrity of their Dealings and Intentions would not exceed 600 him
