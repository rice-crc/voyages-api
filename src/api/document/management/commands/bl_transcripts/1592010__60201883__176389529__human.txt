their feet one Man will do as much in a day as
one Hundred can in the other Manner with [forty].
& I could wish you'd send one or two of y^r long forty
up the River Some height above [Baracuhden],  &
make them wash there abouts & by what then is to
Begot out of the Land, especially in thow Drill,
or little Streams, w^ch run from Some of the
Mountains mention'd in the Journals to be situat 
-ed in the barren parts of the County the most
likely to produce Mines I should be glad too
to know y^r thoughts upon the method he proposes
of Establishing divers, Settlements up the River
which if are discovery of this Sort should be made
would Surely be necessary to secure the benefit of it
from the Natives & others to the Company, & the
it will not be adviseable to run into so large an
Expence as this will amount to unless there is an
apparent likelyhood that such discoveries will be made
as will sufficiently make amends, yet I cannot but
think that a settlement or two made at proper
distances high up the River will be a very great
means of enlarging your trade & enabling you to
open it very beneficially with Divers of the County,
of some of the powerfull Inland Kings & Princes,
when the distance they are at from y^r. present
Settlement keeps from trading with you. I shall
be very glad to know y^r thought in this affair by
the return of Capt. Ham & remain in the mean time
