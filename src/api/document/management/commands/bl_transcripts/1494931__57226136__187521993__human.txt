You think may be followd and Seized, there are always Vessels that may be
hired there for Such purpose
As to the Liberty you recomend to Us to procure for your
Seizing Goods as well as Negroes If You mean at Sea The proposition
would appear Ridiculous, and it would be an Odd exertion of his Catholick Majs
Powers to grant such Liberty even to his Own Subjects Or if you mean at
Land We doubt 'twill not easily be Obtaind all Unlawfull Trade being within
the Jurdisdiction of the Governours, and 'tis scare to be Imagn'd they will put
that power in your hands
We Note Your having on Mr. Denniss Arrival publishd an Indulto
at 80$ p Ps of India upon which were Manifeted 389 Negroes making 240 Ps ofÂ India
and the Reason you give for so doing Viz because the people will have no excuse
when their Negroes shall be seized, they having, as you say pleaded the Necessity
of buying Negroes in the Time of the Reprisalia In Answer to which Our Opinion
is that nothing can be more Encouraging to the private and Destructive to Our
Own Trade than a General Indulto and Especially in Your Parts where the
Introductions are so frequent and they find a ready Vent, Had you Confind it
only in such a manner, as to Answer the Reason you give us in favour of the
Negroes Introdued during the Reprisalia it might have been causable, But as
You did not Restrain it in that Manner And We are assurd of the many You
Indulted, there were but 4 Introduced during the Suspension and as the
Negroes by Two Ships the Berkley and Sloop Content were admitted among the
Rest in 3 Days after they were Landed whereby they received New Life instead
of losing 40 p Ct as they expected- these are Inducements to make Us believe
that the Reason You gave for setting on foot this Indulto was a Fallacious
One and that it was Calculated to favour the private Traders and Your Selves
otherwise We can not Account for this Management. It is further to be observed
that this Indulto was but at 80$ tho in a former Letter you Own that
Indulting Negroes even at 120$ would be an Encouragement to Private
Traders, and Lower the prices of Our Own Negroes
You are Still more absurd if possible in Recomending to Us to tuy
the Negroes of the Private Traders in the Bastimentos, as a means to destroy the
Private
