S.^r Walter Sencerf Kn.^t
I rece'd y.^e Fav.^r of yo.^r & am sorry my
Letter had y.^e Misfortune to come so late to yo.^r
hands since I find y.^e Pictures I desir'd you to buy
for me were sold at very reasonable rates
I must now beg leave to trouble you w.^th another
request, w.^ch is, that you'l be so good to let Capt. Towers
know, I desire he'l bring me over three on four
Dozen of live Quails and as many of Partridge
as of Phesants (if to be had Cheap) I am not sure
whether the two last are so plentifull at Botterdam
but I am in found y.^e Quails are & excellent good,
& y.^e Latter if he'd write to assend might be
had from thence. I don't know whether there are any
Orlelans to be had in y.^e City but if Capt. Sewer,
wou'd give himself y.^e trouble of enquiring IÂ 
shou'd be much oblidg'd to Him & if they are that
he'd bring me over three or four Dozen of y^.e
I rece'd Acc.^t you were pleas'd to send me &
return you my humble thanks for y.^e many Inst
-ances I have reced of y.^e friendship w.^ch I shall on
all Occations acknowledge & return
Yo.^rs &C
