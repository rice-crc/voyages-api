And as We expect every day to hear that the Flota is Sailed
We are preparing to dispatch an Annual Ship for We this Years & to preserve
as much as We can the good effects thereof, We desire you will write
by the Flota to our Supra Cargoes & Factors, and such others as you
Seeproper, advising them of this our Resolution, which will probably
occasion the chief Buyers of Goods to hold themselves in suspence in
Expectation of our Stip
It is also of the last Consequence with regard to the Sales of
the Goods, That We should have the liberty We formerly Dejoy'd of sendir
our Goods up into the Inland Country, and not be confined to Selt them at
the Port of Vi which would render the Sales very slow, few Buyers
of Note caring to come down thither, besides in that case we should
be under the necessity of taking such prices as those people should
think fit to give, And tho by the Annual Ships being there the
Flotistas will probably in some measure be prejudiced in their Sales,
Company would yet be in worse Circumstances, without an equal
Liberty of removing their Goods to Puebladelos Angeles, Mexies, &
other places, especially if a Fair should be proclaimed to be held at
Crizara, Jalapa, Oaraca or elsewhere, and that Fair should be
over before our Cargo can be got to it, As to the Dutys of Aleavalas
We hope youll be able to get an entire abolition of them, and We
think We have a Right thereto by the last Article of the Assiento
which expresses that the Goods are to be Sold Tree of alldutys in the
Indies, which takes in every part and place in the Indies, And
upon which Consideration We have reason to Insist that his CM
did reserve to himself not only a quarter part Concern in the Annual
Ships, but likewise the 5 Psent of the Gain which was expected to be
made on the other threeparts which belonged to England, and of wch
intended Exemption from dutys his CMo was so fully apprived
that as We are inform'd) some Exception was made with respect
to the Companys Goods in the Subsequent Contracts Entred into by
hiis tM with the Farmers of the Alcavalas in Terce and tho this
Exemption will put the Company by so much on a better foot than
the Notistas, yet as it is matter of Right it ought to be preserved
