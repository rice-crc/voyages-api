Mr. Sey. [Comyns], & find He ls very apprehensive
that upon Mr Talbot's misfortune of losing his
Son (which he thinks was the only Child)Â  that
the difficulty will be much greater upon him to
make any security to Me for the Mony I shall
[abatee], however I have such a Confidence
in your good Intention, that I will not make any
seruple for this Once to go out of the Common
road, & therefore upon Mr Jenning Cas Sr. John
for I know not in whose Name so Mortgage is
assigning over to Me the Mortgage of 1100E
I will be ready to lay down the Mony. Youll
please to give me Notice a day before the Assigning
is carried to ^the Parl.^t that I may supply him
with the Mony he is to deliver upon the receipt
of it I have also desired him to prepare the
other Deed which he [judges] proper Mr. Sallor &
his Lady should execute for the security of the
remaining Sum I am to furnish him with &
if he should want any other Writings (for the Will
S.H. Doleman he hath already) you'l please
