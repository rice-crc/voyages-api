delivery of the Negroes on their Arrival may Contribute hereto;
We earnestly recomend it to you to sell for ready money and for the
best prices you can, and not to trust without absolute necessity,
But should it everhappen that you should be obliged to sell any
Negroes on Credit, You are to make strict enquiry into the Ability
of the Person, and not to Trust any one without good Security
And to see that you have a price accordingly You are not on any
Account to take Cascarilla in Truck or purchase any till the
Company shall give express orders for that purpose
31.- And whereas it has always been Customary after
a Suspension of the Assientp occasiond by Ruptures between the
two Crowns, to open an Indulto on Negroes illicitly Introduced
for such a limited time and at such price as shall be thought reason
able, which Indulgence may have a better Effeet by inducing the
people to Manifest their Negroes, than if We proceeded by way of
Seizures, We do therefore give you leave for once to open an Indulto
at Portobelo Panama Lima or elsewhere within the Jurisdiction
or Limits of your Factory for such time and at such price as you
yourselves shall judge reasonable, which Indulto is to be set on
foot as soon as possible after your Arrival in the Spanish West
Indies, to which and you are to apply without loss of Time
to the Governors or other Persons whom it Concerns
32.- Afterthe time fixed for such Indulto shall be
expired You are not to presume to open any other Indulto without
the special leave of the Court of Directors previously obtained But
to Use your utmost Endeavours with the Assistance of the Governrs
and Royal Officers to Seize and Confiscate all Negroes illicitly
Introduced, and which shall not have been Indulted by You, pursu
ant to the power granted by the Assiento Contract, And as an
encouragement for your so doing We have agreed to Allow you
one half of the Nett produce of all Negroes so Seized & Confiscated
at Portbelo Panama Lima or other parts, to be divided One third
of such Moiety to the particular Factor or Factors or other Person
in the Companys Service who shall be present at the making the
Seizures, and the other two thirds thereof among the Factors in
general
