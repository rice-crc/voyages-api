Mr. Woodhouse
I return you the Articles of Agreement with Mr.
Rea executed by me, & I doubt not but you will take
care to see them duly observ'd. I should be glad to know
what you think the amount of those woods bargaind
for will amount to
As Soon as I go down to Cannons I'll look for the
Counterpart of the Lease of Ruckston & if Ican
find it will send it you down as you desire. I think
be have all the Leases copy'd into a Book & sent you
to have recourse to upon occasion, without the Necessity
of sending them backwards & forwards.
As to the Woodlands dont depend So much on the
distance of time as you do upon, its not being worth my
Lady Seudamores while to redeem it, when the Interest
comes to be computed up & added to the Principal
over & above what the rent has produc'd towards paymt.
Taxes &c considered, but be this as it will if she has a
right to it, She ought to be acquainted with the State
of it & I am very willing she should be acquainted with it
pray enquire of Mr. Baker what he asks & will take
for his Estate of Presteigne & desire Youl be carefull
to inform yourself of the Nature of the Herriot, whether
the option of the best beast or a sum of Money for if
it is the first I would not have it if he'd give it me.
I am &c
