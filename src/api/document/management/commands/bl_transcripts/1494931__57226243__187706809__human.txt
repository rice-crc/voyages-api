Approve your doing it, as You find Grounds to apprehend Danger in
any Voyage, and as to Gunpowder and other stores we shall supply
You from time to time as you advise Your want thereof to prevent for

We have Considerd of the two Articles charged in your Accot
Currt. as Comission on Negroes Indulted and seized in the Factory wch
altho you give plausible Reasons for our allowing as we apprehend
may hereafter be drawn into Consequences which at present cant be
forseen & therefore as Commission we dont allow it, altho as partly
the Carelessness & Remissness of our Factors, but more by the deficiency
of the African Compa. in performing the several Contracts madewith

Whereby unusual Quantitys have been sold by the private Traders on the
Coast, whilst you, as well to Yor own as the Companys Detriment
have been little more than lookers on, We are willing to make you
an Allowance of â‚¤1000 in Compensation for that disappointment
and hope in future You will have no reason to Complain.
Me Note Your having red beyond the full of Mr Chaplins
Debt and approve yor detaining the Overplus in Yor hands towards
the Charges we have been put to on that Accots and especially as that
Affair has cost us as well as Yor. Selves a great deal of Trouble We
also commend Your Care of the Effects of those that dye in our
Service, & the Justice you do their Exrs in remitting the Ballances
