I observe by y^r Lett.^r of the 20 Just. you bileive the
tyths this year will amount to 270£ or thereabouts,
 I dont see why you may not include them all
(as I have [wratter] already) in one Article and as
the foot of y.^r Acco.^t which is to accompany the
Rentall you may explain by that means the
encrease [increase] comes.
The Herriots & Cloth you'l bring into your
acc.^t on the Back of y.^r Pentally in the half
year in which they shall be adjusted & sold; in
like manner all payments made out of the
Tyth p.^d should be brought to Acco.^t in their
proper half years, I mention this the rather
brcauto in the instance of Mr. Sager (who
receives I think about 70 [pounds] p Ann.) He is overpaid
for his half years.
Tho there is not much in the Acco.^t I had of
M^r. Wills being put up for a candidate for Bps
Castle, yet I would alwacies [always] have Notice given
me of any such attempt, & if the [lrters] are
people of the Condition you mention, they are
the more Narrowly to be watch't & prevented, if
possible, from entries into engagements, for my
own part I asure them I'l rather lose 20 Election,
than be at the extravigant {extravagant] expence I was the
last time.
I have rec.^d a Lett.^r from y.^r Brother in
which He tells me, He is not willing to give above
80 £ p Ann. for Downton farm, which much sur=
priseth me, you know in the Rentall I bought
it by, it is estimated at 121. L[pounds] p Ann: I wish
you'd go over & talk with him & have the ground,
