Sir
We are to acknowledge the Revtr fyor Letters of the
1t Septemr & 6 Inst with the Carta Ordenes for Buinor Ayres enclosed, &
observe those our Sec) wrote you by our order under date the 14t Augt &
4 Septemr duly came to your hands
The Accot you have given us of the disposition of the Court of Spain
for some time past had fully satisfied us, That your proceding no faster in
procuring the necessary Orders for the Company was not owing to a wans
of Leal on you part, and we are sensible, that whilst the public affairs
& were in that soubtful suspence) the Companys Concerns must unavoidate
meet with remoras and difficultys But We hope ere this gets to your
hands
