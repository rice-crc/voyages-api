Oct^r. 7^th. 1720
The Hon^r. of y^r. Lordships of the
26 is come safe to my hands, & tho M^r. Tripp
hath not acted with that Candour towards y^e.
Lords^p. you expected from him, His behaviour
however hath not lessen'd the Obligations I
am under for y^r. generous Disposition in assist=
=ing me in the Purchase of the advonson He
had the sale of I have a good number of
small Living (from 50 to 100 Â£p ann.) in
my Gift, but as I have none of a Value con=
=siderable enough to render it an adequate
Recompence to any Gentleman who hath spent
great part of his time in my family, I
should he very glad to buy three or four
advonsons of the yearly value or there abouts
as this was represented to y^r. Lordship to
have been of, & notwithstanding the I'll
sucess[success] of this last Negotiation I must
acknowledge with great thankfullness
y^r. Goodness in being willing to have contri-
=buted by y^r. Interposition to have rendred
there wishes effectual .of this I Intreat
y^r. Lord^p. to be [afault/afraid] I have to just a
[sorce], as will make me on all Occations
with great Readyness & Respect approve
my self.
My Lord &c
