Madam
I could never have recd your Command at
a less convenient juncture than this, the few concerns
I have being so much engaged in the Publick Funds
that it is not easy for me to raise any considerable
Sum of Money, especialy when the New Subscription
call for so large an imeiate payment, however if
you'l please to let me know, how much it is you
have occasion of Il endeavour to prevent your
suffering for want of the sume required and if I cannot
serve you myself. Is ty to fild a friend who can.
I am &c
