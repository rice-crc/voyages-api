Exemption by the Treaty in favour of the Company, his EMr
having by the 41 Article of the Assiento Actually dispenced ti
all Laws Ordinances Priviledges, Establishments Usages &
Customs contrary thereto wherever subsisting in the Spanish
America.
This Exemption from Dutys Seems also by the Article
which grants the Annual Ship to be a Condition Sine qua Now
upon which his EMajesty is to have 14 part of the gain, besdes

England, and with that Vion it is presumed that the Contracts
made by his CMajesty with the Farmers of the Aleavalas in

have entituled the Companys Goods to the Privilodge of Eaony
tion from Aleavalas in Peru, there is the same Just Reason
for their Equall Exemption in the Kingdom of Mexico

and Returne by those Ships, It is therefore necessary that this fort
be Explaind, and that ipress Prevision be made that the Compary
may Employ in the business of the annual Ship Such persons as they se filt te
