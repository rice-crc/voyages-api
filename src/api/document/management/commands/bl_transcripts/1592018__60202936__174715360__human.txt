of this to acquaint you that Col^o. Bladen & I
have prevaild upon Col^o. Adde to Supply Col^o.
Dunbars place upon the term of ₤500 p Ann.
Sallary with at any Comm^n: He declining to [in volve]
himself in Mercantile part whereby he'd be
render'd Accomplable. He is a Man of very good
Character that I should think it would be
for the Companys Interest to grant him a larger
power  than what the present Instouctions allow Viz.
That of a Negative Vice in the Councill if He
should hear any Resolution pres't for which might
your prejudicial to the Company Interest.
Col: Dunbar writes me word He hears then
is an Order gone to fetch all the men from
Shipboard who are enter'd in the Companys
service, Surely this cannot be if it is I should think
it would not be amiss if there is a Deputation
or at least of Some of the Gent^n. waited on My
L^d. Ch: Justice to acquaint him with the truth of
the Case, & to remove the ill Impressions which
have been given him of the Companys Conduct=
I am.
