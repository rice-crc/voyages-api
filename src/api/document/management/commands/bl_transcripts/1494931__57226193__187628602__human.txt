the Inclosd Copy. His Grace was forbid passing any Bill of an extraordinary
Nature and Importance wherein his Majestys perogative or the property
of his subjects may be prejudiced, or the Trade or shiping of this Kingdom
any ways Affected, until he should first have Transmitted to his Majesty the
Draft of such a Bill or Bills and should have Received his Royal pleasure
thereupon, Unless there were a Clause inserted deferring the Execution until
his Majestys pleasure be known, This wetake to be a Favourable
Instruction, first given to Sr. Nico: Lawes at the Companys procurement And
Your present Governour hnd done Us but Justice had he Insisted on it There
was another Instruction given St. Nico. Lawes pursuant to the aforesaid Order
of Council which was to Exempt from dutys Such of Our Negros as came
to Jamaica only for Refreshment Under which denomination were included
all that we Imported Our selves and afterwards Exported, but were that
Instruction Continued, it would not avail Us in the present Case or any
future One of the like Nature, where Negroes are delivered on Contract. It
therefore behoves us to get if We can a General Exemption with Regard to all Negroes
Imported on the Assiento Account and Afterwards Exported, which when we
are got into a Settled Method in what Manner to Supply you, We shall be
better able to Judge what Application to make.-
As the Dutys already paid were Collected without Legal Authority,
for such we may properly Say of all Bills of this Nature that they presume
to put in Execution before his Majestys approbation be Receivd in the Island
we shall Remonstrate against it and Endeavour to get an Order of Conncil for
paying back the same, And to prove the Facts we hope your letters and Accounts
will be Admitted as sufficient Evidence, as they were in the former Case, where
they Collected duty on Our Negroes after the date of an Order of Repeal
