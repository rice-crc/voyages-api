To His Grace the Duke of Newcastle
His Majestys Principal Secretary of State
May it please your Grace,
Having received from Mr Cane a hetty dated
at Madrid the 13t May last Enclosing a Translation of the
Marquis de Villariass answer to his office of the 17th of the
preceeding Month upon the South Sea Companys present
Differences with the Court of Spain, importing that his Catholed
Majesty will listen to no applications on the part of the
Company till they shall think proper to pay within the
time that shall be limitted for that purpose the Sixty eight
thousand pounds sterling, and that if they should refuse
that payment His Catholick Majesty will proced to Declare
the Assiento Suspended, and in such case greater Difficulties
will be found than what are perhaps imagined at present
to get the Company Reestablished We cannot but express
thereupon our utmost Concern to find that his Cath Majesty
hath given no attention to the Reasons urged by Mr Keene,
on the behalf of the Company in Support of their Just
Pretensions but Arbitrarily Insists on their paying him
a sum of Â£60000 under the ponalty of the Suspension of
the Assients, without any Regard had to the much larger
Demand the Company hath against him on account of their
Reprisaliated ffeets Seized in the Years 1718 & 1727 in
direct Violation of the Treaty of Assients, and hitherto detained
notwithstanding the express Stipulations in several Subsequent
Treaties for the Restitution thereof
As this is ademand which the Company ought not in
Justice
