		This people-oriented data dramatically changes the nature of our dataset. While Voyages data has always been relational, the complexity of interpersonal connections in this dataset makes it graph-like and pushes the boundaries of the underlying system (Python Django).\
		For instance, you might search for a person who was bought, sold, or transported on a voyage owned by a known enslaver. Or, you might search for people who, based on the sound of their name as recorded, are believed to have come from a particular region in Africa where an ethnic group known to use that name was located.\
		However, it must be stressed that there is a tension in this dataset: the data that we have on enslaved individuals was almost entirely recorded by the people who enslaved them, or by colonial managers who technically liberated them, but oftentimes pressed these people into military service or labor. We know the names of these people, which is grounbreaking for this project because it allows us to identify named individuals in a dataset that often records only nameless quantities of people, but as you analyze this dataset you will note that most of the data we have on these enslaved people is bio-data, such as gender, age, height, and skin color -- this is qualitatively different than the data we have on the enslavers, about whom we often have a good deal of biographical data.\
