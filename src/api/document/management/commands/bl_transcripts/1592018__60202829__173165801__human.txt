apises between the Ld Lievt & Sr. Geo: Carwall, I should
be glad to hear hew it past as for the three candsidates

that two of the three may intend it

giv it is agree for by another at 80000£ which
betwixt friends is for Mr. Secr. Chagge & is a great deal
more than I would have given for it for I am to termind
