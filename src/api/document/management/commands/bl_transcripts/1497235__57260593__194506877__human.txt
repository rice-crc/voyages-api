Sir
By the Order of St John Eyles I send you the Enclos'd
Letter together with Copy of the Lycences for the ships Elizabeth &
Bedford, and of the Validations, desird by yours of the 18; As also
some Newspapers, If there are not what you like best please to acquaint
me and I will send you others
I hoped 'ere now Mr Wescomb wod have been so well Recover'd
that he would have been here and Dispatch'd as usual But he is
still Indisposed and cannot attend I have therefore got all your Letters
together, both these to the Comittee and those to Mr Wescomb which
I have perused and will Collect from our Jamaica Letters and the Letters
from the Factorys, All that relates to Illicit Introductions which the Govr
and other Spanish Officers have protected or seem'd to favour As you now
desire in your said letter of the 18th As to other papers you therein add,
You are also expecting, I must beg of you to Explain what they are, For
you seem in the paragraph to write as if you had those which I find
mention'd in yours of the 16 July to Mr Wescomb. If I mistake please
to sett me to rights and your Comands shall meet with due Attention
Your Letter to Mr Wescomb of 27 Ulto I Judge his last and Mr Reads
Fully Answerd
Your Reasoning in one of your Letters to Mr Wescomb (which
letter I thought I had, but I cannot find it) touching ye paragraph
No 4 in the Heads of Matters &c and the Cedulas relating to
the negro trade therein mentioned Surprizes me; For I dont perceive
any Error in said paragraph, therefore fear some mistake in the
Copying thereof for you, must have been made; So I here send you
another Copy Indeed I woud rather hope that it may appear
