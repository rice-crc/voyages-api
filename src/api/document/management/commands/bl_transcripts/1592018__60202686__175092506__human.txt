it was understood so ^ by you & me. I confess as I had
to do with a Person of Honour I was the less solicitous
about Specifying so nicely as I ought to have done in the
Lease. I will mention one particular which perhaps may
make you [?] that our agreement was upon this
foot Vizt. you were pleas'd to give me an hint that the
ground was Crown Land & that I might perhaps by
my Interest obtain a Grant from the King & then should
be allowâ€™d to enlarge my Garden backwards as much as
I would this I have gone to far towards effecting that I
have already a Promise of it which will be a Compliment
as soon as you can let me know the particulars & the
State of it which you were so good as to tell me you would
in a little time help me to, but you must Sr. be very
Sensible that that part of the advantage arising from
Such a Grant will be defeated if you retain ground enough
behind mine to make a foot path or High way. I must
therefore depend upon your favour to let this ground
remain to me as it was first intended and as it was agreed
upon with your first surveyor & mine and Stakt out
according to such agreement by them that there may
be no Stop to the going on with the enclosure of it.
