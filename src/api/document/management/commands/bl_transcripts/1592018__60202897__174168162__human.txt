times of distress I must at the same
time acknowledge & with great thankfullness
y^r. Caution in not laying out the 4000 E you
drew for, & as there is no prospect of y^r
Bulbley Growing better, I desire You will not
part with it but find some safe way to
remit it me over, if you think it not pro-
per to pay it into Mr. Pels. the 1000 £ S.S
you sold at 290 is not yet taken, & desire you'l
[quiequen] y^r friend to do it. South Sea was

desire You'l observe the Dircetions in my last
