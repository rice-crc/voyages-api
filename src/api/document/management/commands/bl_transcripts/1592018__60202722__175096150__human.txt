Dear Son
Carnawan
I return you many thanks, for yours
& hope this will come to you at Oxford time enough
before you set forward on y^r Journey. If I had any
Horse fit for you to ride I wou^d willingly send it you
down, but as I have none that Ican spare nor
any one so well to carry you as your Spaniard,
You must be contented w^th that, & if you have not
spoilt him since you have had him at the University
he'l perform the Journey very well, for I presume
you will not go above 15 or 20 Miles a day, wth e
will do, I make no question as well as any Horse
Pray tell y^r Brother I am
whatsoever
very anger w^th him for taking my Coach quite
down, I know no reason for it but that Locksan's
Son
