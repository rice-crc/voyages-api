South Sea House 3d Feby 1728/9
Sir
Tho I have several letters of yours to answer I chose
to deferr it, seing I can write you nothing new at present, We cannot but
take notice of the Chicane & evasive answers You have had to your Meml
and that of Marg de Paz to Yr Self on ye subject of ye Cedula for ye Stores
from Jamaica Seems to be a Master piece for he would first persuade us
that there's no order subsisting against our Carrying Stores by Negro Ships
& that it has always been so practiced by us both which are false
fact, the 34th Art. being expressly against it, nor did we ever do it but
once to Buenos Ayres wth a few Coals, & other trifles, and then they were
Seized & taken away and upon this foundation he would ground the
denyal of ye Cedula, as unnecessary, However if We can have it in an
other Shape till there's a better understanding the sooner ye better; but in
the Carta Order which you mention you propose to get yt Letter inserted
& Comanding ye Spanish officers to observe & execute its Contents, I
Submit it, whether the sophistical & evasive arguing therein, may not
render such a Carta Order ineffectual & unintelligible; these are my
private thoughts; if I am mistaken, ye Zeal I have that ye Compa
may not be treated & bamboozled as they have been, will plead in Excuse
I am sure with you, who are so will a Wisher to it likewise
I must notomit to put you in mind of the leave the
Comps desired you to procure for ye store ship for Bunos Ayres: We he
some Ships are failed for that place from fadiz twould be a satifaction
to hear you had sent ye orders for those part by them
I have ye pleasure now to acquaint you, that ye Corm
of Directors have settled yor appointments in ye same manner as Mr
Stratfords were vizt 5000 Dollrs P Ann includling Coach hire, pritas
& other incident Charges (except postage of Letters or any Extrac-
presents) And as the first Letter they wrote you on ye Comp. affains w
dated the 29 Feby last, they give you the Comencement from that tim
So that you may draw on their fashier Mr De Gols for ye year ons
29 of next Month and in future every to Mss as Mr Shalfor did
I remain wth all Sincerity
Ar nost humd ferd
