Therebeing no otherwords in the Contract wch relate to
the Time or Manner of rendering the Accounts of Annual
Ships We humbly apprehend these Words must be understood
to relate thereto, and that they evidently Import That these
Accounts are to be rendered together with those of the Assient
every 5 years according to the 29t & 30 Articles before mentiond
And the Reason why the Accounts of the Annual
Ships are thus Stipulated to be rendered together wth those
of the Assients feems plainly to arise from the aforesaid
Consideration upon which His Catholick Majesty granted
the Dnnual Ships, namely, the Loss which might be
Sustained by the Assiento Trade
And as tlis Catholick Majesty has agreed by the 28th
Article to reimburse the Assientists for their Losses by
That
shall suffer Losses, His Majesty will be obliged to Cause
them to be reimburs'd so far as he is Concern'd according to Justice
Bythe29 and 30 Articles, The Assientisto are to
give an Account of their Profits and Gain, to His Catholick
Majesty, and his Shares of the Profits is to be adjusted and
Recovered from them every five years during the Assiento
And by the last Article called the Additional Arkcle, wch
is the only one wherein there is any mention made of the
Annual Ship, His Catholick Majesty Considering the Losses
which former Assuentists have sustained, is pleased to allow
to the present Assientists an Annual Ship, In which his
Majesty is (Igualmente) equally or in like Manner to
partake of the 4th part of the Gain (come on el Assiento)
as in the Assients.
