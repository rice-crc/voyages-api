Time I remain
Sir &c
1720 June 23rd
I have rec^d. your letter of the 19 Inst: I desire to
know what that parcell of Land in the [parks] which
you mention is, to whom it is left & for how much-
As to the charge upon the Parish in which Mr. Powells
Estate yes. I have yet heard nothing of it, & would there-
fore have you sen me an Acco^d. of the nature of it.
If the Estates w^ch you say are to be Sold, are let to good
Tenants & upon Lease, I shall be willing to purchase
them or any others of the like nature near my Estate
in Radnoesh which I would enlarge. You will take the
Meadow you mention & buy 10 or 12 Oxen and turn them
into it and according as they prove I shall know to proceed
another year.
I had forgot to acknowledge the Receipt
of yr Letter of the 12 Instant. You will give an Acct.
how you dispose of the 160 E which you recie^d from Mr Wordhouse
to Capt. Oakeley. As to the 2 Trees fallen by agreement
with Mr. And. Harley you will let them be carryd off when
ever they are wanted. and Since the 2 others were
fallen without the Gentlemans knowledge or directions &
are of so little value you may acquaint him they are
likewise at his Service
I am [S^r]
