Mr. Sely
your I have [fewer?] Relationsof my own & more of
my Acquaintance who are in a worse Condition
than you represent Yours, & yet it is not possible
for Me to make even their Circumstances such as
I cou^d wish to see them. How can it then,
Madam, be thought reasonable at the time
when I am for it to refuse them that I sh^d
maintain One who hath so considerable
Persons for her near Relations & to whom I 
an no ways related, have no Obligations to or
Acquaintance w^th You'll pardon y^r freedom
w^th. w^ch I write this, since ty to remove any
Thoughts you might entertain that my silence
proceeded from any other Motive. However
since you are pleas^d to say it shall be the
last Time you'll desire this of Me. I [write/wrote?] 
Note for 10 G^s  of w^ch I [?] y^r Acceptance
Iam etc.
