Regulating the Assiento Trade were agreeable to the Treaty
which ought therefore to be observed whether the Company
consented or not If this were the Fact, the Company would
have no Reason to Complain, or to dispute paying obedience to
those Orders, but what is complained of is, that several
new Regulations, not contained in the Treaty of Assiento
having been proposed by Sir Thomas Geraldino to the Court of
Directors relating to the limitting the Numbers of Negroes to be
Introduced by the Company in proportion to the Tonage of their
Ships, their having in consequence thereof sent orders to their
Factors or Agents to conform thereto was construed as an Agreement
or Convention between Sir Thomas Geraldino and the Company from
whence they could not afterwards recede without his Catholick
Majesty's consent, Whereas the Companys orders were only
given to shew their readiness to comply with his Catholick Majestys
pleasure in any thing that might not be prejudicial to their
Trade, but they never had the least thoughts that in Case upon
trial they should find a compliance therewith attended with ill
Consequences they should not have it in their power to Altor
or revoke those orders in the same Manner as they may do in all
other Cases relating to the Management of their Affairs within
the Terms of the Assiento
11th. The Eleventh Head of Complaint was That severall demands
and pretensions had of late been made in the name of his
Catholick Majesty either contrary to or not Warranted by the
Treatys, not withstanding which the Company were threatned
That in case of non compliance therewith Measures would
be taken by his Catholick Majesty to enforce their Submission
