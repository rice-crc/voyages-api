Mr Cantillon
I return you Enclosed the letter
You had from Mr Bell [Peli], you are Certainly
very much in the right to guide your
self by his Intelligence in affairs of the
Nature you wrote about, he cannot
fail of having the best Intelligence
from the nearness of his relation to the
Great Man You Mention, & I have on
several occasions found them to be such
as Could be depended on. What I wrote
you formerly was purely out of a
Concern of Friendship for your Welfare
You had often acquainted me with the
Distrust You had of the Sincerity of the
Professions made you in France & that
You went to Italy was Chiefly to be out of
his reach, supposing since that time, you
are so well reconcild, that you could be
willing to trust your self in his power
ground
& you best know your Self what was the
Wideness between You) Yet are you satisfy
he will be able himself to maintain his
Ground, & if you come to be one of the most
Considerable next him, & to be chiefly entres,
by him. (Other wise it will hardly be worth
the While of One of yr Fortune & Experience
to embark, Again, in business ) are, you will
afraidÂ  that should he fall a Sacrifice yr
other friends would be able to protect you
