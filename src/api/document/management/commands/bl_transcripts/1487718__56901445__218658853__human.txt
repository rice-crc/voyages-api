whose Sentences an Appeal (in Such Cases as the Law Allowes) shall
lye to the Supreme Council of the Indies, which Judges Conserva=
p tors the assientists may remove, and Appoint others at pleasure
upon Shewing a Justifyable cause for their So doing, in the
ye manner as Set forth in the said Article
Notwithstanding which Exclusive Power vested in the
Judges Conscivators, a long Contest or Competition of Authority
was carried on in the Kingdom of Mexico, between the Comps
Judge Conservator and the Tribunal of the Consulado there, as
Appears by the Autos of that Suit in the Companys Possession
In which it appears the Vice King took upon himself to determin
that the Judge Conservator should have no active Jurisdiction, but
be limited to Causes only wherein the Compy are Defendants, and
not when Plantiffs, from whence arose great Difficultys to the Comps
in recovering Debts and opposing the hardships put on them, and
Several of their Dependencys which were Coynirable only by their
Judge Conservator, were brought before other Judges or Tribunals
to the great Grievance and oppression of the Congs in direct Viol-
ation of the said 13 Article, insomuch that the Judge Consenvatons
power is almost wholly Annihilated, tho the Company at the same
time pay them very considerable Sallarys
It is therefore of very great Consequence to the Company
that the said 13 Article, and the Exclusive powers thereby given
to their Judges Conservators be inforced under Some Senalty, and
that an Express Provision be added to the said Article, That no Judge
or Tribunal whatever (save the Comp Juidge Conservator shall be
deemd Competent, or their Sentences of any Valeity in any Cause
relating to the Assionts, whether the Comp are Plantisss or Defarid
and that in Case Notwithstanding this Provision, any Vice Roys
Audiences, Presidents, Governours or other his E Majestys Ministers
or Tribunals, Shall presume to Interfere in any matters, Apper=
taining to the Judges Consenvators Cognizances, Such Vice Roys,
Audiences, Presidents Governours or other Ministers or Trbunals
so interfereing shall be lyable with their Persons and Estates
