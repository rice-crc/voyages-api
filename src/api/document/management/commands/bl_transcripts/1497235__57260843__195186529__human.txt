P.S.
We have been inform'd that Mr Bulpon's
chests and Tounks were opend on board Shy
and are surpris'd that no books or other papers
belonging to or that might give Information
to the Company of the state of their Affairs
at the Panama and Portobelo Factory
have appeared he having been a Porson of
whose punctuallity and Honesty We had a good
Opinion, And as We are assurd he did desire on his
Deathbed that nothing might be opened but delivered
to you in the Condition they were. It gives us tor
much ground to suspect this proceeding of ye
his Chests was done with a Sinester View and that
Some Concerns Papers or Memorandums have
been Emberzled or Secreted, We are following this
Enquiry here yet further, and desire that you
will give us an Account of what Information
you have had concorning this matter and that
you will make all the Enquiry you can into it
of the Capt Mr Garvey the Supra largse or
my others; and if any books Papers or
Memorabidums are Come to your hands relating
to the Company, you will send us an Account
of them
