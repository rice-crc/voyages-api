I hope y^r Lordship was no ways inrole'd in this
General Calamity, which will make my own Misfortunes
Lit the lighter on me the yatchts are orderd
for the King, & Ld. funderland is expected soon
Over. I beleive the Union at Court was not small
Surprise to y^r Lordship is having been transacted
with so much [seency,] that hease any one was
apprisd of it, besides the three or four that manag'd
it. I doubt the reconciliation amongst the
Misters is not so cordiall, as they promist
themselves from it, & I fear there still remains
a rancour in the Breast of some, which will show
it self the first opportunty there is for it.
People begin to whisper as if this Part : would be
continued & an Act brought in the sessions to that purpose
whether there is any ground for that report I know
not, but [Jarks] lately one of the Ministers, who
would own nothing of it.
Mr. Brunsdale will inform yr Lordship the state
Yr. Own Estate, is generally thought the man who
bought it, will not be able the comply with his
bargain, & I heartily wish y^r Lordship could be
the purchaser of it. this I beleeve might be
affected by an agreement with Mr. Packer at a small
Expence & it would be a great satis faction to all your
friends to see you master of it again that all [eep]
& Happiness may attend you in what you desire, it
the sincere & hearty [night] of him who is with great
Respect & Affection.
My Lord &c
