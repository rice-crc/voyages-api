Dear Cap.^t
I have look'd over M^r Pyes Lease
to me of the Mynd, & find its dated on Sep. 1715 to have
& to hold for 7 years from Midf.^r 1715 so that the first
half year's Rent became due [mas] 1715 & left [mas]
there were 4 1/2 years [illegible]. this will be a guide to you.
in the making up the acco.^t w.^th him.     I shall not
be unwilling to purchase the Advowsons of Bredwardine
& Brobury, as soon as you can get perfect Information
of their value, but 5 years purchase is more than I
will give.    I have order'd M^r. Gray to send you
down the Fish & other things you desired & assure you
I am very Sincerely
Yours &c
