Sold, you are to use your best Endeavours to that End for preventing the
charges and Accidents of sickness and mortallity which attend the

Enquiry into the Ability of the Person, and not to trust any one without
good Security, and to see that you have a price Accordingly, you are

24 You are to use your utmost Endeavours, with the Assistance
of the Governor and Royal Officers to prevent all manner of Clandestine
Introductions, which would be very prejudicial both to his Cott and
the Company and if you at any time discover Negroes illicitly brought
in, you are to seize and Confiscate the same, pursuant to the power
granted by the Assiento Contract for which We agree to allow you one
half of the Next produce to be divided one 1/3 to the Factor seizing the
other 2/3 to be divided among the Factors in General according to their share
in Commission, And you are not to presume on any Account or pretext
to open an Indulto without the Leave of the Court of Directors previously
Obtaind. It is not unlikely but it may be pretended that our Assients
and the Several Cedulas for suppressing Clandestine Introductions of
Negroes have been suspended by the Difference between the two Crowns
of Great Britain and Spain, And that therefore the Company have
not power to Seize or Confiscate the Negros so introdue'd during the
War; you are therefore to observe that That Suspension, did not
warrant any others to introduce Negroes into the Indies, and
that the suspension of the Assiento and Cedulas being now taken
& by the Peace lately Concluded with Spain, and the same being
by the Dispatches you have with you again reestablish'd as before
the War, you are to put them in Execution with all possible Effect,
they being sufficient for you to Seize and Confiscate as well whas
Negroes have been illicitly introducd during the War as well as
before or Since, But should any Difficultys arrise in relation hereto ye
you cannot Surmount even with the assistance of your Judge Conser-
