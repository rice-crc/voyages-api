From a Dear Sister &
Countess
Madam
1720 April 20
of Granville
I rec^d [received] the hon^r. [honour] of y^r. [your] Ladyship
& assure you I never heard either from Lord
Castlemain, Mr. Walcot or any other person,
of your inclinations to have subscribed for Lord
Carteret in the Affrican Engraftm^t, if I had
shou'd have used my Endeavours to have serv'd
you in the manner you desire but it is now too
late the Books are closed & the Subscriptions
so much more than full, y^t I have not been
able to oblige half the Number of Friends I
wou'd willingly have help'd in, nor even that?
I did obtain Subscription for, cou'd get above
You'l see
one third of what they desired.
Madam by w^t [what] I have the hon^r. [honour] to write how
very different my case not only is but always
was, from w^t [what]. you take it, I find to be, by your
saying, it is so absolutely in my own power,
since I was so far from being the Author of this
Scheme, that notwithstanding w^t [what] the Town is resolved
to report, I knew nothing of M^r. Walcot's Design?
nor had heard the least Tittle of any such Scheme,
being upon the Anvil till after there and been
above 1200,000 subscribed to it, & it was as
much as I cou'd do afterwards to get in my self.
