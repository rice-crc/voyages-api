Duke of
Berwick My Lord
It is some time age since M^r
Stratford acquainted me w.^th your Grace's Desire
to have a Copy of the Picture I have of your
illustrions Relation the Duke of Marlborough
I have been under no small Concern that it was
not in my Power to obey y^e Comands sooner
but y^e Painter who I was willing sh^'d copy it
(being ye best hand for y^e work in England) having
been for some time ill, I was obliged to defer it till
his Recovery put him in a Condition of being
able to finish it: it was drawn just after
his disgrace upon y^e alteration of y^e Ministry
towards the latter End of the late Queens Reign,
w.^ch was y.^e Occason of S.^r Godfrey Kneller's
Fancy in placing y^e Figures of Brittanca
Lugeas & the Eagle drooping in the side. I
beg y^e Grace will be assured I have a very
sensilih [illegible] Pleasure in meeting w^th. this
Opportunity of making my Court to you.
for whose Personal Merits I have the
Highest value, & to whom I am with
the greatest Respect
My Lord &c
Sir He.[Henry]
