With an acco^t [account] of the accident which befell Lord Carnarvon
and of which I had heard before I saw it in Rint, as oft. [often?]as I
did hear it, I contradicted it taking it for granted, had there been
any ground for the Report, you wou'd not have fail'd to have
acquainted me with it to whose care he was more particularly
entrusted, nor can I dissemble my thoughts so much, as not
to own I take it amiss you did not, how great, or how little
soever my Fears wou'd have been upon receiving this news
immediately from you, or had I been never so much of the
make with the man who rode over the Board that was laid
across Rochester River when the Bridge was down, I can't
perceive how any reasonable Man cou'd immagin, they wou'd
be lessn'd by my hearing it from others, and not knowing the
Truth of the Fact certainly you cou'd not think twas
possible [for was crossed out] an Accid^t [Accident] of this Nature cou'd be conceal'd especi=
ally in the Case of one of Lord Carnarvon's Rank, if you
did the Event shew'd how wrong you judg'd, there having been
20 Lres [Letters?] sent up to Town every one (almost 100) giving a
differrent Relation of it, before it was in the Papers, so that
I think I was the only one who had heard nothing of it, besides
I cannot forbear saying that if the Relation I have heard of it
is true that Lord Carnarvon was in such Danger and sav'd by
Cap^t. Marchant's leaping into the Water and catching hold of
his Lappett in Justice to this Gent. I ought to have had as
early Notice of it as cou'd be Iwish you an happy Continu
=ance of your Journey and a safe return to Oxford Iam Sir
Your
Lord Carnarvon Cannons May the 7^th. 1720.
Dear Son
Yours of the 4^th Inst. [Instance] came safe to my
Hands, and I congratulate you on your Escape in Northampton
the News of which wou'd have been as welcome to me had it
come.
