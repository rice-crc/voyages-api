We are Assired the Annual Ship is not given up, as was
Commonly said, but that we are to enjoy the full priviledges of the
Assiento Freaty and Convention &c and these will be as good a
Warrantee against any Siicurer or difficultys like what have
been in time past, as the nature of things will admit So
that We are buoy'd up with tollerable hopes
We have considered the Remark you have made on the 1th
lead of our Explanations, and also the Cedula of the 8th Deb. 1726
and are of Opinion that as it recites the Cedula of 20 October 1724
which expressly injoyns our bringing the Negroes from Africa
directly, and towards the End directs the Govern to take Care to
Conform to the Litteral Sence of his  Royal Orders, it is necessary
that that Cidula. Should be revokd, as well as the Cedula of the 20th
Octobr 1724 in as much as it being of a Subsequent date to the
Cedula which gave us the Liberty of Apme Stay in Jamaua that
Indulgence is thereby Supercided
Tho' we know of no other particular Cidula that rerokes it
the words of this are too Strongly Enfored, to Suppose any Validity
left in it, you will therefore Correct any thing you may have
writ to Mr Keen on this Subject
This being post day the Comittee were not willing to Sly
it, and therefore have order'd me to Sign. I am Sr
Your most humble servant
