I have re^d the few of Yours & if it
was in my power would readily serve you in what
You desire, but I found by experience from the ill
success I met with in my endeavour to true some
friend the last subscription that I had too little
Interest with the Directors to hope to obtain what
I should ask of that sort from them, &l try how-

that yr. Commnand will be alwaves very welcome
to.
