p Ann. or thereabouts unless I can be sure
that the Guards who takes it after the year
is out will repay me & take the stock [sc]
to himself in like manner concerning the
proposall you make of building a New -
House, I should be glad to know what
the repairing the present one will cost

the [best] House in the [Countye] if not, it will
certainly be adviseable before one undertakes
such a piece of work, to see a plan of the
intended building & an Estimate of the expence
& how far the old Materials may be employ'd
towards it. I shall be glad to receive your
answer to these particulars as soon as may
be & remain
