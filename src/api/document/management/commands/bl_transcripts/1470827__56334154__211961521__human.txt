The Committee took into Consideration the Chev. Eons Memorial
which was referrd to them by the Court the 6th Dect last, And Conferrd with
him upon the Several Articles
As to the first where in he presses for the Speedy Establishing
a Factory in the Province of Carraccas & Maracaybo, The Committe Concur'd
in Opinion with him That Establishing a Factory might be a means to prevent
Clandestine Trade, but argued that the Charge was certain and too great to be
supported by the Negroe Trade to those parts, without some priviledge to
encourage them to be at such an Expence; And therefore they had lately
besought his C.M. to allow them a General Liberty of Introducing Flower
and Naval Stores into those parts, which could be of no disservice to his,
C.M. but on the Contrary of Great Service to his Subjects, who now supply
themselves with every thing they want from the Clandestine Traders, But
as answer was come to this their Request, The Chevl was desired to Use his
Good Offices for obtaining that Liberty, To which he said that he would
write next post to that End.
As to the 2d Article Wherein he desires a Copy of the Cargo of the
Royal Prince bound for Vera Cruz that his CM might be informed of the
Particulars the Chevl. having explained his meaning to have an Account
of the Quantity of Each Specie of the Goods with the Costs and Charges. The
Committee are of Opinion that such an Account be forthwith drawn Out and
deliverd him
