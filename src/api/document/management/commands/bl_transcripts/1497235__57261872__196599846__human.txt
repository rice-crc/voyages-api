between the Powers of Europe particularly those of Great Britain and
Spain, We take this first opportunity of Congrahelating with you

Advantage of both Crowns as well as the Company

Factory at your place under the Management of Mr Jonathan Dennis
Mr Hubert Tassell, & Mr Leonard Cock who will have the honour to
deliver this to you, and being sensible how much it imports the

have your Countenance & Protection, We earnestly recomend them to
your Savour not doubting that from your Justice & other good Qualities
inherent in you, we shall experience an imediate Restitution of our
Effects Embargud & a successful progress in our future Comerce
