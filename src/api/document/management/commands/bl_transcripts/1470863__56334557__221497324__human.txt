If so the Compa are charged by the Havana Factorys
Invoyce of the Bridgen's Cargo, with Cost & Comission on 134 pounds
in the abovemention'd 4 Boxes only, more than the Compr really
have any thing for.
It is therefore the opinion of this Comittee, That a Letter
be wrote to Messr. Clifford & Comp desiring They will cause all
the sugars by said Ship to be weighd exactly, and an Accot thereof
to be taken & sent to the Comp. And also that they will take
the best Methods they can for ascertaining the Real Tare of all
the Chests & Boxes of Sugar, and adjust the same with the Buyer
thereof & transmit us the same, that So the Company may be-
enabled to send the proper Directions to the Factory at Havana
for their Government in future
Likewise that the Exact weight of the Smuff be Sent
us forthwith in order to Settle with Mr Munor.
