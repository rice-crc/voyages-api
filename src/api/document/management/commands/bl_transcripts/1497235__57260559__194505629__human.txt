fell them, and the Annual Ship instead of being of any benefit as Orgne
intended would in this case be greatly prejudicial, and it was for this
Reason his Coll was pleased by his Royal Cedula dated 27 Septd 179
Expressly to grant and explain this Priviledge, and as the true meaning
and Intention of his Original grant by Treaty, and therefore we look or
it as one of the things Atipulated to be preserv'd and maintain'd by the
Preliminarys especially the 3. Article
The Sum of what We have said on these points amounts to this That
if at any time We sell our Goods, when there is no fair, whether it be
n port, or in the Country, We are Content to pay the Dutys, as his Cit
Subjects do; If We sell them at the fair, whether it be held in Port or in
the Country, We are Exempt, and that We have a just right to Carry them
to the fair wherever tis hel  he Plotistas do
If therefore you find any hesitation in admitting the Right
of Internation by Treaty pursuant to the Late Kingâ€™s Cedula of the 27
Sept. 1721, which Explaind it, and that they are backward o unwilling
to Revoke, the two Cedulas of the 1st. of March 1723/4 and 8th Decbe
1726 both which Contrary to the Treaty and the Cedula of Sept. 172
Deny and forbed that priviledge, Or if they make any difficulty in
Explaining the Point of Alcavalas According to our Sence & means
which we think the true and genuine Intent of the Treaty, Yor
must immediately inform Our Agent at the Congress Mr Rigby, That
he may make it a point of Complaint there.
We shall be glad in proper time to hear of your Sucess
in these Matters, because our Entrance again on the Assients
Limerce, will greatly depend on their being Clear and express herein
lest We should be a third time involvd in the Perplexitys We have
been This being Port day the Cince were not willing to Slip it,
and therefore have Orderd me to Sign I am
Your most humble Servant
