Madam.
I rec:^d the Honour of Your Ladys:^p letter and
am very glad it happned to be in my power to render
you any Service that was acceptable to you, but must
own at the Same time I am under great confusion to
find it so abundantly overpaid by the acknowledgm^t:
you are pleas'd to make for it. M^r. Gibson tells me you
propose to repay on Saturday or Monday but as I should
be sorry you should part with any stock you have, to raise
the money, at a time when there is such a Prospect
of Advantage by keeping it longer, I desire you will
let it remain as tis till the opening the Books at which
time I shall have occasion of it for payments which-
will fall due & M^r Gibson shall waite upon y^r Ladyship
then to know whether it is convenient for you to
I am &
return it.
