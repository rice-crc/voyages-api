Sir
I have sent to my Surveyor to attend
yours tomorrow about the measurem.^t of the Ground,
but he is not in Town, & I cannot speak w.^th him till to=
=morrow evening, so that I must desire their meeting
may be put off till Thursday about ten at w.^ch Time
He shall not fail to be there. but I must entreat,
I may have a positive answer as to y^e Inheritance
& the buying off of the Ground Rent & reducing it to 10^th
paid , w.^ch you may remember, Sir was w.^t I formerly
had hopes of from you, w^thout w.^chÂ  twill be too great
an
Imprudence in Me to lay out so considerable a Sum
as the Building an House on that Ground will cost
me. Wherefore I must beg that these two points
may be ascertain'd, & y.^t I may have an answer
as soon as may be, since my going into S^t. James's Squared
will depend upon the Resolution My Lord Harley
takes upon this affair.
I am &c
