Gentlemen
Our last was of the 4th. October rie Jamaie Copynle
Since which We have none from you, tho Weare not willing to think you
would let Slix the Opportunity which Capt Williams made use of
whom We receir'd adre of the 1st of August, Via Gibraltar, Advising the
Arrival of the Orders for restitution &c, the Restoring the Sd Frederct
and the snows being also order'd to be deliver'd up, And We hopeson

own Judgement not doubting but you will preserve your Setves
well able to Satisfye us, that you transact every thing for our best

the Court of Spain, and We hope they will soon be with you, If
