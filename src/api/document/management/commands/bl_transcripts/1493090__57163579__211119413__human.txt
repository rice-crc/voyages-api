Seared Curlians Dr Paul D. Stahan, and Do Lee who
have been Consulted on a Case Stated upon the said Treaty
a Copy of which case with the Civilians opinions thereon
is hereunto annexed And it seems the more Evident
that this must have been the sense and meaning of the
Treaty in regard that if it should be construed in the
sense expressed in this Article of his Cath Majesty's
Answer, it must have from the begining in his Catholick
Majestys power (without contravening that meaning) to
have rendered the Treaty and Contract absolutely without
Effect by giving an Interruption to the Trade as soon as
begun, which if he had pleased might have lasted during
the whole 30 Years, as in fact it hath already been intenupled
for about seven years of that Term, and altho we pay the
greatest Regard to his Catholick Majestys promise in this
article, that if after the year 1744 there should remain
any Sum unpaid to the Company, it shall be paid to them
imediately or the Term of the Aessinto shall be prolonged
until it is satisfied, Yet as there are several other
Dependancys between his Catholick Majesty and the Company
besides what are now proposed to be adjusted, the settlement
of which must be reserved to a future convenient Time, and
for other Reasons mentioned in the Explanation to the Plan
we humbly hope from his Catholictk Majestys Equity he will
be pleased to Explain his Sentiments touching the Continuance
of the present Assiento conformable to what we humbly
conceive was the intent of the Treaty
His Catholeck Majesty in the reat Article is pleased
