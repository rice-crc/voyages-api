Extract of the Court of director tetter
to Mr. Keene dated 5th December 1734
The Company have Sustained a very great
Loss and damage by their Faculty of Lycencing
Negroes to be Carried to the lesser Ports of the
Indies, having laid so long Dormant by
reason We pay the Dutys for the full Number
of Negroes; and as to any other Concessions which
We have made to the Court of Spain at the
Instances of St. Thomas Geraldino, and which
His Excly M Patino calls Agreements,
We apprehend they cannot be deemed such
but are only Experiments, and should they
at any time prove of prejudice either to
His C.M. or the Company, they are no
longer to Subsist, For it would be extremely
Unjust, That any regulations not Stipulated
by the Treaty, but yielded to by us out of
Complaisance to the Court of Spain, and with
a View to His C.M. and the Companys
Mutual Interest, should tho they prov'd
hurtfull to one of the Contracting Partys,
be nevertheless Insisted on by the other, as
New Agreements, and to remain in Force,
