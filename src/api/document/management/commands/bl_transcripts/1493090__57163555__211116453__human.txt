and the Royal Officers
It appears from the Tenor of the Companys Plan
and Explanation before recited That the principal
Object they had in view and the strongest Inducement
they had to agree to Account for the dollars payable to
his Catholick Majesty for the Negro Dutys at so high
a Rate as 52 pence P dollar being much beyond what
was paid for the same from the begining of the Contract
and before the Alteration of the Value of Dollars in old
Spain, and to pay the Amount thereof and of his Catho
Majestys Share of the Profits of the Annual Ship the
Royal Caroline to his Catholick Majesty in ready Money,
while so much greater Sums remained due from his Cathe
Majesty to the Company on account of the Reprisaliated
Efeets the much greater part of which had been due
ever since the year 1718 and the remainder ever since the
year 1727 the payment of which was to be postponed
for a considerable time, the principal Motive and
Inducement for the Companys agreeing to such hard Terms
was, that the Account of the Reprisalias might be
ascertained, and that his Casholick Majesty should declare
and allow the Ballance of that Account to be a certain
and Liquidated Sum due to the Company in all Events
and to the End the Settling and agjusting of the said
Accounts might meet with as little difficulty as possible
the Company agreed to let the same be Settled even upon
the Foot of the Accounts thereof made up and Settled by
the Spanish officers themselves so that at least it might
appear
