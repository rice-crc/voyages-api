To His Grace the Duke of Newcastle

The Memonal of the Court of Directors

May it please Your Grace,
The Court of Directors of the South sea Company
having received information by a Letter from his Excy Mr Keene
dated at Lisbon the 30th of April last addressed to their Sub
and Deputy Governors, of a Contract or agreement made by
the King of Spain with one Don Joseph Ruiz de Noriega
of the Commerce of Cadiz dated the 4th of September last
for the Introduction of 5000 Negroes pieces of India, or more
if necessary within the Term of two Years into the Kingdoms
of New Grenada and Peru by the way of Carthagena Panama
and Portobelo under the Conditions therein mentioned, They think it incumbant on them as well, in regard to the publick Good as to the private Interest of the Company
Copy of that Contract as transmitted to them by Mr Keene,
with an Observation or two which they humbly beg leave to
offer to Your Grace on this occasion
The Distress the King of Spains Subjects in America
appear to labour under for want of Negroes sufficient to
Cultivate their Fruits, work their Mines, Repair their
Fortifications, and for doing other laborious Services as well
of a public as private nature, in which they have been
usually Employed, occasioned by the interruption of the
British Assiento by the present War, and the Difficulty
is not the Impossibility of those Provinces being sufficiently
Supplied with Negroes by any other Nation but Great Brrtain
and the detriment thereby arising to the King of Spains
Revenues
