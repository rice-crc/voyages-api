that time prepard, of which the Secretary has a draft, The
Sence of the Comittee at that time is Shewn, which agrees with
what we think reasonable That the said Comission of 1 P
Cont be drawn by the Agents at Jamaica, on all – Remittances
of money and Effects from the Several Factorys to them, whether
the Same be Expended in the Companys Service on the Island, or
Remitted home by them, and that with regard to the uncertainty of
the Value of Jamaica Money, They be allowd to take their
Comission of 25S P head upon Negroes, in Ps of 8/8 valuing Each
peice of 8/8 at 6 Shillings or in Bills of Exchange to be drawn upon
the Company at 30 P Cent at their own Option
Mr Hearne of Cadiz being dead, who with Mr Hancock
was the Company's Agant there, the Comittee considerd of
Setting a new Agency at Cadiz for dispatch of any Business
of the Companys that may arise, and Messrs. Bowman Son
and Mayne being well recomended and known to Several Gentle
­men of the Comittee, They are of opinion to recomend them to
the Court as the Companys Agents at Cader
