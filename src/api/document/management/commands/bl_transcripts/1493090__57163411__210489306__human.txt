unaccompanied with a specifiation of Facts
2dly That it is pretty remarkable that at the same times that
the answer takes notice that the Generality of the Complaint
deserves no particular Answer, yet It supposes That the Spanish
Directors here complained of have been forced to such Measures
by the Arrogance and Obstracy with which the Companys
Factors have refused to comply with the Strpulations of
the Assiento, and also supposes, that this their refusal
was given with no other view than to Conceal Their ellicit
Trade But as these are more Suppositions and do not
appear supported by Proofs, The Company can only Reply as
to Facts Those they have Complained of are Hardships
pet upon their Factors and Factorys Ships and Effects by
the Spanish directors for the Factors not complying with
his orders, which were not only not warranted by the
Stipulations of the Assient Treaty, but in contravention to
or derogation of the said Treaty, as by the several troofs
which the Company are ready to produce may appear
And as to the Allegations that the Companys Factor
at the Havana had obstinately opposed the very orders
in which the Company had acquiesed The Company deny
they had at the time of that opposition acquiesced or given
the Factor any directions to submit thereto, Nor have
the Company to this day acquiesced with those Orders
otherwise than by directing their Factors to submit thereto
under a Portest to avoid greater Embarrassments in their
affairs, the Company conceiving those orders not to be
agreeable to the Assien to Teaty and tending to put great
Difficultys upon the Management of their Trade
