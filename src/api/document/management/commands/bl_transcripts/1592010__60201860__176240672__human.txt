to secure the Person I intend to set up: pray
lett me know whether you have been round
the town to engage them to [reason] their.

hereafter, & y^r. living in Bps Castle was
calculated also for that end & to keep up & fix
a sure Interest; I shall be glad to know
what fruits I am to expect from these ex-

if you have not done it already (which I
cannot think you would omit upon M^r.

many votes promist for the Person, I shall
Set up, as you can & let me know the
Number of those who promise, & who refuse
& who are doubtfull.
