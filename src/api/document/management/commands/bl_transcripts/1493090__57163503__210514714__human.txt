his Catholick Majesty and the Company by the Assiento Treaty,
to which their particular Agreements witho their Licensees
have no reference
The sixth Reason mentioned is That the Bills for payment
of the Appointments of the Junta rose 25 P Cent imediately
after the alteration in Spain of the Specie
To this the Company can only say that was an Accident
neither in the power of the Company to Create or to prevent, and
therefore they think it not material to decide the Question in
Dispute And on this Head they cannot but observe that his
Catholick Majesty as well as the Company always understood
from 1716 till 1733 when Sir Thomas Geraldino first Started
this New Objection, that the value of the dollars or Specie was to
be regulated by the Course of the Exchange between London and
Madrid all the payments having been accepted by Spain
according to the Course of Exchange which has always varied
from time to time, and a further Argument for the regulating
those payments according to the Course of Exchange may be drawn
from the 10 Article of the Assiento which Allows the Company to
Invest and bring home the produce of their Negroes in Fruits of
the Country or in Bars of Silver or Gold the Specifick payment
in Escudos would in that Case become impracticable, & therefore
the payment must be of that which was the value of the
Pesos Escudos de Plata, and this could only be regulated by
the Exchange, which would determine that Value on the foot
of 8 Rials Plate p Piece of Eight Since of Spain was to oblige
the Company in this Case to pay the Pieces of Eight on the
Foot
