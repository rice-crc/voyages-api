the Terms of the Act of Parliament, the Sollicitor for the South sea
Company made enquiry at the India House to see whether any and
how much of the India Stock had been transferred and found no part
thereof had been transferred but that the India Company had directed
The Executor should be allowed to transfer the whole of the Stock in
their Books, whereupon the Sollicitor for the South sea Company
caused the Agents who had applied for the Transfer of the £10,000
Southsea Stock to be acquainted that as none of the India Stoct
was sold, and as the produce of the £10,000 SS Stock would be
less than the Money to be paid to fir Joseph's Executor the
objection against allowing more Stock to be sold than necessary
to raise the Money payable to said Executor would be removed if
They sold the South sea Stock first, and then sold the India Stock
according to the unrestrained permit given by that Company, But
the Agents applying for the said Transfer did not think fit to take
that Method, but proceeded first to Sell the India Stock, which has
raised more than the Monies payable to sir Joseph Jehyl's Executor
and the Objection made by the Sd S Companys Council remains
emamovedo
The Court of Directors of the South Sea Compy apprehand
as Trustees, they cannot with Justice to their Proprietors, without
a proper Decree for that purpose, admit any Transfor of Stock
whilst they are advised it may not be done with safety to the
Company, But in case the Opinion of his May Attorney Genl
be given on a proper State of the Case that the South sea Company
may with safety permit the Sale and Transfer desired, We are
well assured they will readily Comply therewith. We are
