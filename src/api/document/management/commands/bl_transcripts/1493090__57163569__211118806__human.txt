"performed as mentioned in the Cedulas either in America
"or in old Spain at the end of three years to comence from
"the day of their being presented in the West Indies the
"Company may then retain the annual Amount of the
"Negro Dutys
To this Article we beg leave to oberve that his Catho
Majesty postpones the time when the Company is to have
recourse to the Negro Dutys for satisfaction of their demands
in case of non payment in America or old Spain, to the
end of three years after the presenting the Cedulas in
the West Indies, Whereas the payments by the Plan
are to be made in the West Indies by equal proportions
every Six months to the End the whole may be compleated
in three years, and therefore in Case of failure of either
of these half yearly payments within the limitted time
of its becoming due, they humbly apprehend it agreeable
to the highest Reason and so they have expressly
mentioned in the Explanation of the Plan that they
should from time to time have recourse to Old Spain for
Satisfaction of each respective payment when not complied
with in the West Indies, and for want of payment in old
Spain within three Months after application made, they
should then be at Liberty to have recourse to the growing
Negro Dutys in their hands
In the neat Article his Catholick Majesty Agrees
"that if at the end of the Term of the Assiento in 1744
"according to the Treaty, there should remain any sum
"unpaid to the Company, it shall be paid to them imediately
