coming to a certain Knowledge of the Justice of the
Vicars Demands & according to y: [the] opinion am willing
to allow him six pound p ann: for the time past
in full of all his Demands upon [illegible], & desire your
further opinion what allowance will be proper
to make him for the future in lien of the
Several Items you mention. You'l pay him
the arrear & charge it in your next account.
As to M^r. Waltony at Shelton (Kid walladers)
I have actually bought & paid for it, so that I must
make the best of it, & accordingly you'l receive
the growing Rents, which are due to me from Lads
Day last, for I made M^r. Walton a Compensation
for that Rent. if I am not mistaken, but you
shall know the Certainty by next post, you'l give
Order for putting it into a good substantial repair:
The Lease at the Munkhall you need nor
has the trouble of Sending up before it is
engrost, & ready for me to execute. I give you thanks
for the trouble in attending you Capttain [Rupells]
body to the grave.
I find I was mistaken in the article of
[Meek], I thought it had been but 14£ p ann
whereas I see by Yours it is to [h] 22£ p ann
I cannot but own what you say about
repairs is very just, & tho [illegible] an heavy Article,
yet I am for having them so well done, that there
in as be no danger of future expence on that hand
