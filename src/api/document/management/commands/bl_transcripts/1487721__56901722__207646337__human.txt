To the Kings most Excellent Majesty
The Court of Directors of the South sea Company most
humbly Crave Leave to Represent to your Majesty that they had
rec advice from their Factors at Jamaica of the 12 Novr Last
That an act was then passed by the Comons, & Council and was
Expected Daily to be passd by the Govr whereby a Duty of 20
p head was to be payable upon Every Negro Exported from that
Island, which Duty will Greatly affect & prejudice this Comp
in the Carrying on their Assiento, For that the Company do Cause
all their Negro Ships Designed for any of those Northern Ports of
the Spanish West Indies to touch at Jamaica for Refreshments for
the Negros, and Landing and Recovering such as are Sickly, And
also frequently Buy Negros in that Island, whereby Many Mutual
advantages arise to the Island & the Company But if the said Duty
be Imposed the Burthen thereof will in Effect be a prohibition of
that Island to the Company. And they will be thereby Necessitated
to proceed with their Ships of Negros Directly from Africa to the
Spanish Ports, without any Opportunity of Landing or refreshing the
Sickly to the Great Detriment of the Co & prejudice of the said Island, who
thereby will be Deprived of the Many Advantages they now Reap from
the present Method of the Companys Ships touching there And Reexport
their Negros in Sloops & Vessels of that Island to the Encrease of their
Navigation and Encouragemt of their Seamen &c
Wherefore The said Court of Directors most humbly
entreat that ye Maiesty will be graciously pleased by your Royal
Authority to restrain & Disannul the said act of the Assembly
of Jamaica So far as the same Shall Impose Any Duty upon
Negros Imported into or Bought in the said Island, and by them
reexported thence to the Span West Indies
And that your Majesty will Likewise be graciousy
pleased to give Directions to the Govr of the said Island for the Time
being not to pass any Act whereby any Duty shall be laid on Negroes
Exported thence by this Company to the Spanish West Indies on Accot
of the Assiento
By order of the Court of Director
