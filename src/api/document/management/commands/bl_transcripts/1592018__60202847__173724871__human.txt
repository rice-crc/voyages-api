D^r. Sir
Your last contain'd such Instances of friends
as give me great reason to hope, I shall succeed in
the request I am going to make you & w^ch. being
of a nature that requires dispatch, I am forc'd to
send a messenger on purpose to you about the
very great & Suddan fall of the Stocks, as it
hath plung'd whole families into irretreivable
ruins, so hath involved even those who thought
themselves most out of danger under no small
difficultys, I thank god I have escaped the

to arm myself Sufficiently against the latter
& the vexation I am under to find myself indebted
to any body in such a time of General distress
