It appears to the Committee that Orders were given for prosecuting Mr
Thorowgood son after the said Censure past upon him but your Committee cannot
find that there were any proceeding there in which gives us Reason at this
Distance of Time to imagine there was no sufficient ground for it, and the rather
because the Court Samd to have a better opinion of Mr Thorowgood upon their
futuro Examination in to the Affairs in Dispute for it appears to this Comitte
That the Court of Directors the 31 Jan 17th discharged the Toint Committae

said Committee were Considered in a Court of Directors calld for that purpose on
the 12th April 1717. And that a Copy there of with Remarks was sent to the
Factory at tera Couz in the Courts letter by the Royal Prince dated the p July

Several Papers which he calld Accompts and which he says
