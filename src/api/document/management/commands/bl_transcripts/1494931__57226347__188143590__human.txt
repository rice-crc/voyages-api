Mr. Withers
Mr Harris in whose Favour the Court of Directors
formerly granted 3 Lycenses for to Negroes each upon paying an-
Indulto of 80 Ps 8/8 P head as mentiond in their Letter of 3d Octr
1723 having represented that it was a Mistake in Settling So much
P head for that it ought to have been So much P Ps of Inda according
as the said Negroes shall come out upon their being regulated. And the
Court having considerd thereof & finding what is proposed to be agreable
to what is practised at Jamaica, & to what was formerly done at
Barbadoes, they have Consented to what has been desired: So that upon
payment of the 80 Ps of 8/8 for every Ps of Inda the said 30 Negroes shall
produce they have no objection to the discharging the Securitys enterd
into on this occasion, provided the Articles in all other respect be
complied with. This is what I am orderd to acquaint you with
and am
