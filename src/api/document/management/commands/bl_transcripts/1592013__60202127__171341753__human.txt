Sir,
Iintended to have done my Self the Honour to have
waited on you before I came out of Town, but was prevented by
some unexpected Buissiness which hindred me, if I had I shou'd
have acquainted you, by Word of Mouth what I take the Liberty
now to do in writing Vizt that I have discours'd Mr Taylor,
in
who assures me that the whole 34 odd hundred pounds is
r
to carry interests; that it was intended so by the Commiss
in their Decree, and the Decree accordingly drawn up, and in
his Opinion very clear and full to that Point, however if
there is any Doubt of it the Commissioners will make no
Difficulty to explain it to your Satisfaction. He tells me the
4 Nominees will readily joyn in the Sale of the Estate which the
Commissioners are impower'd to make by Virtue of the Act
of Parliament I have the Honour to enclose to you. I have
wrote for a Rental and hope to receive it in a few Days, if
th
there are any other Commands, You have to lay on me I shall w^th
great Pleasure receive them being truly Sensible of the generous
Civility you have shew'd me on this Occasion, and which will
engage me Pretually to acknowledge my self with great
Your &.
thankfullness Sir
If your Council Sir have Still a Doubt about the
whole Sum carrying Interest. I confirm by this what I had.
the Honour to promise, that I am willing to make up and
allow in what Manner You please the Payment of the Interest
for the Sum above the 26500 Original Interest.
