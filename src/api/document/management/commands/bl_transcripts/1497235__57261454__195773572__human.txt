very material for them to have had from you an authenticated Co

to pursue them, but that the Negroes will be freely admitted & fiffee
to be sold, and that in all respects the Asseents will be furrent and
meet with a better Settlement than hitherto This is all hane
at present in Comand to write You I remain
