Lost, and you had the misfortune to be kept out of the Carta Ordenes till
the Flota was saild our affairs in New Spain continue under bad
Impressions for want of fresh orders, as you will have seen by Mr
Nicholson's Letters which you forwarded to us from Havane, which
even goes so far as to say Orders were arrived from Spain for Stopping
the Sd. Frederick, it is therefore of Importance that Wesp imediately
&forward what you can first procure whether Carta Ordences or Cadulad
especially those for New Spain, and if you find any Conveyance from
Cariry for those parts We recomend it to you not to letslip the oppor
tunity of sending them, letting us have duplicates to forward by
way of Jamaia
I would alsokbe of sevrice to procie a Corcular Letter
from Mr Patino to the several Governments in the Indies, Notifying to
them the Conclusion of the Seace, that after so long a Suspence they mar
have an Assurance from their own Ministers of a good Harmony between
the two Crowns, and to desire their favourable Treatment of the Assients
Affairs and to give us no cause of Complaining, which Letters may be
sent with the other Dispatches for Vera Cour and Havana, and
those for the other parts We can better forward our selves
We observe what you write as to the Comissarys,
and as Mr Latmns is likely to be one We could wish that as the
demands We have on the Court of Spain are founded on Justice & Equity
which is all We ask you could induce that Gentleman to be of the
same Opinion, and Consequently a speedy redress would be fauilitated
