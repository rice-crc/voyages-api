I would desire too that they may be brought directly to
my house in St James Square for I would not willingly trust
them to the Inn I believe it will be best to have them
rackt upon the place. I shall be glad if you send up a
Caskett of the French white to taste & if I like it I shall
be willing to have a good quantity of it as I shall also
if the Mangoze proves very good to have half a Dozen
Hogshears more
