Sir John Eyles communicated your Letter to him from Paris
of the 15 November, and having taken their Opinion as to the Tender
of your Service, they directed me to acquaint you, that they do not at
present know of any Service you can do them in those parts. I therefore
wish you a good Tourney home being
Sir yourmost humble Servant

South Sea House London 22 Dec 1727
Gentlemen
The Court of Directors have received your severas
Letters up to the 23 Sept. and I hope a little time will give them
an Opening of a more regular Correspondence, what I have now
in Comand is to acquaint you that they approve your proceeding
with regard to your paying the Sailors and the further promise
you write you were obliged to make them, and they desire you to
do the like by any other Seamen of the Companys Sloops as
such Seamen shall arrive with you
They also direct you forthwith to Sell such of
their Negroes as remain by you undisposed of with the Provisions
and other things relative thereto including such Stores belonging
to the Sloops as are most liable quickly to perish and as You Judge
will be more for the Companys Interest to sell than keep, resererving
however such a quantity of the Stores as may be Sufficient to
fit out two or three Sloops on any suddain Occasion
They would also have you dispose of the Spanish
Sloop
