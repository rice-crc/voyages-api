Sir
Being deserous to give the best and most speedy
Answer in our power to your Letter to us of the 12 Instant relating
to a Representation to the Lords Commissioners of his Majr Treasury
by Mr Jekyl Executor of Sir Joseph Jekyl Knt late Master of
the Rolls That notwithstanding he had been impowered by Warrant
under his Majesty's Royal Sign Manual inpursuance of an
Act of Parliament, to Sell £10,000 Capital South Sea Stock in
the late Sir Joseph's Name, he was not permitted to Transfor the
same the South sea Company being advised by their Council that
he had not sufficient Authority for that purpose, and that their

in the said Warrant. We have enquired into that Transaction,

of the Court of Directors of the Southsea Company, and that the Chief
Clerk in their Transfer office being informed that the IndiaCompany
had at first made some doubt as to the permitting a Transfer of the
Stock in their Books, but had afterwards allowed the same to be made
he was desirous to have the opinion of the Southfea Companys Council
taken on the Will Act of Parliament and Sign Manual, which was
accordingly done, and the opinion being that the making a Transfor
of any more Stock than to make good the £13582:9:2 to be
paid to the Executor of Sir Joseph Jekyll would not be warranted
under the said Act of Parliament and Sign Manual, The Partys
applying for said Transfer were acquainted therewith and
Shewed the same, who declared that the value of the India Stock
was more than was to be paid to sir Joseph Jekyle's Executor
and that they should not concern themselves any further therein
or to that Effect We have been further informed that in order to
get the said Transfor allowed according to the Sign Manual within
the
