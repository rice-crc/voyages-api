That notwithstanding such Report, the Company could
not obtain any Order on their Memorial as desired, but in November
1749 some doubts being made, as to the Right of the Company a
New Reference was made to your Lordships to the Attorney General
on the Doubts made, and for him to take the whole of the Affair
his
into Consideration, and Report the State thereof with his Opinion
what was fit to be done therein
That in January 1749 the Attorney General made
his Second Report to your Lordships, and thereby, as Your Memorialid
have reason to believe, after having Stated and Considered the Doubts
made and the several Acts of Parliament on which Your Memorialid
found their Claim, he has Reported the South Sea Company to be
well Entitled both inlaw and Equity to the matter by them
prayed, and that directions might properly be given by Your
Lordships accordingly
That your Mimorialists afternear three years
Sollicitation, at a very considerable Expence, were in hopes to have
received your Lordships directions according to the Prayer of
the Companys Memorial, and have not been wanting to apply
for the same, but notwithstanding the Sollicitation on behalf
of the Company, continued for near two other years since the
last Report of the Attorney General, Your Memorialists
find themselves without any Benefit from their long and
expensive application
Your Memorialists therefore hope to be excused in
this their repeated Memorial and pray that your
Lordships will be pleased to take into consideration
the last Report of His Majestys Attorney General
and give directions that the Memorial of this Company
so long depending may be complied with
By order of the Court of Directors
