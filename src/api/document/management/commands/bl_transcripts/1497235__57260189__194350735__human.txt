to Antiqua, and the defects in the ship, that it had been deemd
upon a Survey that she was not worth repairing. The Sub
Governoue has also laid before us a Letter from Mr Bumpsted
advising the Condemnation of hee; But there are other private
Letters come to our knowledge which do not well agree with
what either of you have writ us, which give us a reasonable
doubt of the Necessity for your deviation to Antiqua, or for con=
demning the Ship; But however ill or Imprudent this pro-
ceeding may prima facie appear, we shall suspend our
Judgment till we can more fully and Satisfactorily inform'd of
the Truth and Cixrcumstances of the Case, It has occasion'd a
great deal of Norse and Clamor in the Town, who Seem prejudices
in Opinion that this has been done with a Fraudulent Intention
against the Insurers, tho we are unwilling to Entertain so haid
an opinion; We trust you will be able to Satisfy us and the world
that you have not done or Sufferd to be done any thing but what
proceeded from mere necessity.
under this unhappy and To Surprizing a Ciicum
-stance we do consent and order, and accordingly have directed Mr
Bumpsted by this Conveyance, that all our Treasure be put on
board the Kingsale Man of War, for which the propee Bills of La
=ding must be taken.
And as to the matter of the condemn'd Ship, it is our Strict
and positive Orders, and accordingly have directed Mr Bumpsted that
her property be not on any acco or pretense whatsoever Alionated
or that any other stores be disposd of till our further orders, as not knowing whether we may
not by the next Shyp, which will soon follow this give directions for hee
being refitted so as to be brought home by some means or other. This
