# VOYAGES API

The following notes provide an overview of how to install and run the SV API project, which is a restructuring of SlaveVoyages.org to bring it closer to a true microservices model.

For notes on how to use the API, see the [Project Structure readme file](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)

For a Swagger UI presentation of the API documentation's generic public endpoints, go to the root url of the endpoint:

* Running locally: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
* Current public location (subject to change): [https://voyages-api-staging.crc.rice.edu/](https://voyages-api-staging.crc.rice.edu/)

## System Requirements

For reference, this document was written while testing on a 2022 MacBook Pro 
running MacOS Ventura and Docker Desktop 4.21.1.

Install the macOS Xcode Command Line Tools.

```bash
local:~$ sudo xcodebuild -license
local:~$ xcode-select install
```

Install Homebrew.

```bash
local:~$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Install and configure the GitHub CLI.

```bash
local:~$ brew install gh
local:~$ gh auth login
```

Install Docker Desktop.

Optionally, download and install manually instead of using Homebrew.

```bash
local:~$ brew install --cask docker
```

## Getting Started

Change to your local project directory (in this case, `~/Projects`).

```bash
local:~$ cd Projects
```

Fork the `rice-crc/voyages-api` repository and clone to your local environment.

```bash
local:~/Projects$ gh repo fork rice-crc/voyages-api --remote --default-branch-only --clone
```

## Local App Deployment

Change to the cloned repository directory.

```bash
local:~/Projects$ cd voyages-api
```

Copy the default config files for each app component.

```bash
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ cp api/voyages3/localsettings.py{-default,}
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ cp geo-networks/localsettings.py{-default,}
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ cp people-networks/localsettings.py{-default,}
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ cp stats/localsettings.py{-default,}
```

Download the latest database dump from the Google Drive project share and 
expand into the `data/` directory. Rename the expanded file to `data/voyages_prod.sql`.

Build the API containers. The component containers must be built separately.

```bash
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker compose up --build -d voyages-mysql voyages-api voyages-adminer voyages-solr
```

_Note: you can remove the `-d` option to run the process in the foreground. JCM always does this to watch the logs._

Allow a short bit of time for the mysql container to initialize. Then inject the sql dump.

```bash
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker exec -i voyages-mysql mysql -uroot -pvoyages voyages_api <  data/voyages_prod.sql
```

Verify the data import.

```bash
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker exec -i voyages-mysql mysql -uvoyages -pvoyages -e "show databases"
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker exec -i voyages-mysql mysql -uvoyages -pvoyages -e "show tables from voyages_api"
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker exec -i voyages-mysql mysql -uvoyages -pvoyages -e "select * from voyages_api.voyage_voyage limit 1"
```

Run the app setup and configuration tasks.

```bash
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker exec -i voyages-api bash -c 'python3 manage.py collectstatic --noinput'
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker exec -i voyages-api bash -c 'python3 manage.py migrate'
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker exec -i voyages-api bash -c 'python3 manage.py sync_geo_data'
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker exec -i voyages-api bash -c 'python3 manage.py sync_voyage_dates_data'
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker exec -i voyages-solr solr create_core -c voyages -d /srv/voyages/solr
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker exec -i voyages-solr solr create_core -c enslavers -d /srv/voyages/solr
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker exec -i voyages-solr solr create_core -c enslaved -d /srv/voyages/solr
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker exec -i voyages-solr solr create_core -c blog -d /srv/voyages/solr
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker exec -i voyages-solr solr create_core -c autocomplete_sources -d /srv/voyages/solr
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker exec -i voyages-api bash -c 'python3 manage.py rebuild_indices'
```

Build the API component containers.

```bash
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker compose up --build -d voyages-geo-networks voyages-people-networks voyages-stats
```

## Generating an API Key for the Flask Components

The Flask components of the app require an API key.

Create a new Django superuser account through the CLI.

```bash
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker exec -it voyages-api bash -c 'python3 manage.py createsuperuser'
```

Use those credentials to log in to the Django admin interface at 
[http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/) and create an API 
token for the account.

Update the `stats/localsettings.py` and `networks/localsettings.py` files with 
the new token.

Restart the Flask component containers.

```bash
local:~/Projects/voyages-api$ docker restart voyages-geo-networks voyages-people-networks voyages-stats
```

## Cleanup

If you want to tear it down:

```bash
local:~/Projects/voyagesapi$ docker compose down
local:~/Projects/voyagesapi$ docker container prune -f
local:~/Projects/voyagesapi$ docker image prune -f
local:~/Projects/voyagesapi$ docker volume prune -f
local:~/Projects/voyagesapi$ docker network prune -f
```

* Redis: [http://127.0.0.1:6379](http://127.0.0.1:6379)

## Geo Networks

This container runs NetworkX and Pandas in order to build splined geographic sankey maps that are aggregated in a weighted manner on shared routes.

When initialized for the first time, for voyages and people, at region and place levels (A total of 4 runs):

* Creates a basic geographic network in NetworkX
* Asks the voyages-api component for relevant geo data to flesh the map out
* Then pulls the full itinerary for
	* the class in question (voyages or people)
	* at the resolution in question (regions or places)
* For each of those entities
	* It draws the full, splined path
	* Stores the touched nodes and edges in a dataframe
* At the end of each run, it
	* Loads the full dataframe into memory
	* And dumps the results to a pickle file under /tmp

This can take 15 minutes. When initialized subsequently, it loads the pickles into memory in about 2 seconds.

## Adminer

The Adminer container is provided as an optional way of working with the database.

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 and log in with the following values.

* Server: voyages-mysql
* User: voyages
* Password: voyages
* Database: voyages-api

## Development Workflow

This project follows a fork-and-pull workflow.

* The `rice-crc:voyages-api` repository is referred to as `upstream` and your fork as `origin`
* The upstream/develop branch serves as the default change integration point between developers
* A developer makes Pull Requests from their origin/working-branch to upstream/develop

Keep the following in mind when contributing code.

* Keep your fork up-to-date with the upstream repository
* Always start new work with a new working branch
* Periodically fetch and rebase the latest upstream/develop changes onto your local working-branch
* Do not make Pull Requests containing untested or unfinished code unless intended for temporary review and discussion
* Clean up the work in your local environment once a Pull Request has been accepted and merged

Use the following git process to contribute work.

```bash
git fetch upstream            # Pull the latest changes from upstream/develop
git checkout -b <short-desc>  # and create a new working branch

git fetch upstream            # Do work; before any commits, pull the latest
git rebase upstream/develop   # changes from upstream/develop and rebase onto
                              # your working branch

git add . && git commit       # Commit your changes to the working branch
                              # Repeat pulling changes and adding commits until
                              # your work is done

git push origin HEAD          # Push the working branch to your fork and make
gh pr create --fill           # a Pull Request to upstream/develop

git checkout develop          # Once the PR is accepted and merged, delete
git branch -D <short-desc>    # your working branch

git pull                      # Pull the latest changes from upstream/develop
git push                      # and update your fork by pushing to origin/develop
```
