Mr Gibson
Sir
When I saw You yesterday, you told me
as I remember, if I had Occasion for any further Sum, You
believed you cou'd supply me with it I am to receive 10^m Cap.
:/:/:/: on the 23^d. Instant which I intended to have made up by
taking the Differrence but as the Stock in all Probability
cannot fail to rise much higher it will if I can take it be
Still so much more Advantage to mne and therefore if you
cou'd help me to 18000 by that time upon the same Terms
in all Respects you wou'd still add to the Obligations you
have already bestow'd upon Sir
Your &.
You desir'd I wou'd secure you the
Subscription of 10^m in the Affr: (African) Scheme
which I have done but must desire
You'll let me make use of your Name
for 50^m in the whole the other 40^m being
for Friends who are unwilling to have
it in their own Names.

Sir,
I send you inclos'd my List which I
desire may be incerted amongst the Subscriptions; it comes
to a large Sum but by means of it there may be a Saving in
the other Book my Cor: Walcot gave you of the two Sums
of 25^m each put down without a Name, and which were
intended for me as also of 10^m out of the Article of 20^m for my
Lady Child these will reduce mine to about 400000 the Sub=
Scription I told You I must necessarily have. I have discours'd
with Lord Carlton about this Affair, and find him Pfectly (perfectly)
disposed to support the Scheme but unwilling to concern
himself in the Management of it, and therefore declines
being a Director. He is intirely of Opinion that the calling in
So large a sum as is proposed will be of great Prejudice to the
Company and give ground for many speculations and Jealousies
and thinks it much better to leave the last Call of 10 P Cent
to
