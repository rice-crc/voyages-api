S.^r
I am much oblided to you for the trouble
you have been so good to give your self about
the letter I sent you from M.^rs [O danger] I
confess the Settlement of the family Estate upon
me in failure of S.^r Tho.^s [issue] Male, was
what I had heard of before, & what S.^r Thomas
himself not long before he dyed, told me he
either had done or would do, & the same He
also told my Father: but never having heard
from My Coz.^n Geo. [Brydges] (with whom I was
very well acquainted, that he had put in
Execution those Intentions, I took it for granted
So Thomas had alter'd his mind: when I heard
of this I was apprehensive that all the whole
Estate (not knowing that any part of it for
having forgot it) had ben purchas'd by my
present Coz.^ns father) had gone except
Keynsham to my Coz.^n Mitchells son, but if tis
only those Estates in Somersetshire which you
Mention I am Satisfyed a great deal more will
come to my family than what the agreement
between My Coz. BrydgesÂ & Me upon the foot
of a Smithfield bargain could, have requir'd (X
which I shall alwaies very thankfully attribute to
your friendship:) & that this will be the case seeing
likely enough for I question whether a will can
revoke a Settlement without such a power of
revocation reserv'd in it. you'l excute this trouble
beleive me to be
D^.r. S^.r. &c
