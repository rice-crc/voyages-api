I am much obliged to you for your Willingness
to come & assis me in the Port Cap. Rusell
had, but as I have put the Management of those
[set] Matters upon a different foot to what they were
before, I shall have no Occation of giving you
that trouble, but return you many thanks for y^r.
Readiness towards it. I am.

I rec^d. the fav^r. of yours & return you many
thanks for the trouble you have taken in the affair
of M^r. Norman, I shall be glad to talk with him
about it, & wish He could to me at Cannons on friday
Morning when I shall be down by eleven a clock.
You did not mention any thing in yours of the terms
upon which He is willing to come, & which is very
Necessary for me to know, since as, I shall not
allow so much as I did to Cap. Rusell (w^ch. was 80Â£
p ann:) in regard the business it not above halt
so much ( the farming part being to be put
under another) perhaps this Gentleman may
not think it worth his while. I am
