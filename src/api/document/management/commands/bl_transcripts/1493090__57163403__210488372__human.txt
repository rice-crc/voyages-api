upon a former Application made to the Spanish Court, been thought
proper by them to be redressed For upon a Representation made
in October 1734 by Mr Keene to his Catholick Majesty of the great
prejuduce the Company suffered by the shutting up the Ports of Peru
M Patino in Answer thereto in February following acquainted
Mr Keene that his Catholick Majesty had given orders that
provided due Care was taken to prevent illicit Exportations
the Company should meet with no Impediment in the Extraction
of the said Effects: It is therefore the more strange that not with
standing these Orders said to have been given, and the Methods
proposed by Mr Keene for the fully preventing such
illicit Exportations, this Grievance should have been
continued
5. In relation to the fifth Article namely that altho by the
Assiento Treaty there were to be but Two Spanish Directors in
the West Indies for the Affairs of the Assiento yet several more
have been there appointed to the great Delay & Embarrassment
of the Companys Affairs, To which M Patino was pleased
to Answer that he had fully Justified in his Letter to Mr Keene
of the 17 Novemr 1733 the Right of his Catholick Majesty
to name more than two Spanish directors in the Indies The
Company beg leave to observe that their Complaint on this Head
consisted of two Points
The 1st was that contrary to the Assiento Treaty more than
two Spanish Directors had been appointed in the Spanish
West Indies
The 2d was that such appointment of more than two had
proved a great delay and Embarrasment to their Affairs
