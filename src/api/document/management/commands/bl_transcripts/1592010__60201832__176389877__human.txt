have not been able to send you sooner a Copy
of the lett.^r I mention'd from M^r. Sterg to the

by the Comp: from their Service if they desire
the Character this Gentleman (who is a very
[wealthy] person himself I am [told]) gives them:
I am truly sorry engaging in this
Service should have occationed you any prejudice
I am sure y.^r declining to go at the instance

no small dissapointment [crossed out] hath proved a
great expence to the Company & I must own

I could not but be much surprised to see them
charge with breach of promise pards you
having never heard that any were made Yeus
& knowing very well that the alteration of
the Comm. (or rather the allowance, fixt for it
has no secret to you for some weeks before you
took the resolution not to go & which you
were pleas'd to write me word, proceeded
from the unhappy situation of y.^r own affairs
& y.^r not being all to find the saurty the
Company are obliged to require from how
who serve them abroad with the Commission
you were to have had. if y.^r Accounts & Demand
