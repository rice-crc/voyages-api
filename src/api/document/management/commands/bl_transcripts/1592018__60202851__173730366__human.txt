Septem^r 30th 1720
M^r Canbllon
Since my last which I sent by express
& which I hope is come safe to y^r hands
thing here have taken a quite different
turn, the resolution of the general Court
have in pow evry one with New life &
Stocks are using apace, South Sea is growth
up to 350 & all buyers, so that desire
You'll not sell my S: Sea for my Account
under 500 or at least 450 & instead of
remitting any many over hither, if you
will pay M^r. Pels 100 Hundred thousand Gil^r
& send over ten thousand Guincas from Rotordam
it would make me perfectly easy & shall ever acknow=
=ledge the Obligation. I hill transfer to y^r Order
a sufficient Quantity of either South Sea or Ind: for
ap Security. Young M^r. Senceef hath wrote to his Father
at Rotterdam to provide the sum mentioned in Guineas
& if you can without inconvenience to y^r attain assist
me in the manner I have desired you'l do a very
great kindness to Sir &
The 200. Gildern should be paid into M^r. Pels for Sir
Math: Decker Account.
I should hope this turn of affairs here would
produce the like in thou of Holland if so woud not
be pradent to lay out some thing more in those
Babbly in Order to lighten the Cost of what you
already hath bought for me.
