Amongst the many endeavours I have us'd.
to raise mony in this time of Distress, I have
found one who can lend me one Thousand
pounds upon said. Stock, I don't know
whether such a trifling Sum can be of any
use to You, & there fore have deferr'd returning,
an Answer till tomorrow morning, I desire.
You'l send one word whether it will be of
any service. I shall also have I believe
3400 £ in S. S. Bonds sometime tomorrow
I am very willing to stand to the Left of
the Desco^r. & would heartily so any thing
else in my power to accomodate you, Jeannul
[Acct.] hope I shall by degrees be able to pick up.
a further sum & as fast as I can, you may
defered upon receiving it am most sincerely
F. F. &.
