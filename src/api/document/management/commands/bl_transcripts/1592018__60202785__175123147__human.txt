Lord Slawell
It was but the other day [fred] the Honr of yr
Lords^.p Letter date April 26 so that it must have
[lain] a long while by the way; however as it happens
y^r Lord^. hath [suffer'd] nothing by it, since there is no
foundation, that I know of for the report you
have heard, of a new Subscription to the African-
Comp. their Capital is already two Millions, which
is a vast sum to carry on any trade with nor have
I yet heard any reasons, which can convince me, that
a larger is any way necessary. Yr. Lordship doth
me great Justice to believe, that I should be very
ready to render you any service in my power, and
you may be assur'd that on all occasions you may
entirely comand
My Lord &c

Sir
Â I rec^.d so generous an Instance of yr Curlity in
the advance you made me of the mony, I had Out in
Mortgage on the late L. Bolingbrooks Estate that I
should have thought my Compliment to ye Lady there-
-upon (& of which you are please to take abund antly too
much notice) too mean to hav offerd her, if I had not hopd
it might fall in my way some time or other to show my
thankfullness in a much better manner, & I entreat
you sr. to be perswade that whenever I have the good
fortune, I shall most gladly lay hold of the oppos tunity
being truly sersible how obligging a mark you gave
me of yr friend hip when you conferrd that favour
upon me and which will always induce me to acknowledge
my self with hee Respect
R &.
