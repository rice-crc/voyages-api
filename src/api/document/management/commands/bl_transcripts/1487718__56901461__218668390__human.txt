1725 Prince Frederick Sent to &Cuur
1726}
1727} Suspended by a Rupture
And whereas the Company have had frequent Occasion
to Complain of Codulas Surreptisiously procured; by the Enemys
to their Commerce, and Secretly Sent to the Spanish West Indies
in Contradiction to the Treatys, and to the publick Cedulas obtain
in favour of the Company, One Instance whereof among the
many that can be Enumerated, was, when the Company Sout
their Anual Ship Royal Pince in 1723 to & Crur, there was at
the same time Secretly Sont with the Fleta that year, a Cedula
prohibiting the Sale and delivery of any of the Companys Goods
Sent by that Ship till two Months after the Flotas Arrival, in
direct breach of the Treatys, particularly the Convention of 1716
and a prachicemost pernicious to the Trade and Interest of the
Company; and by the same Rule, his C Majesty might as
well have suspended, and may hereafter Suspend the Sales for
any Number of Months longer, and how Consistent that would be
under the present Restriction of Selling their Goods during the time
of the Fair only is material to be remarkd.
It is therefore necessary that some Clause be inserted
in a New Treaty, that all Eedulas or Orders that have been Secretly
or publickly Issued in prejudice of the Companys Privilodges, con-
trary to the Treatys, and to the Cedulas which his C Majesty hav
granted in their Favour, or to what they ought to Enjoy pursuant
to the 39: 41, and 42 Article of the Assients Contract be Revoked, and
for provanting in future the obtaining Codulas in a Clundestine Maner
that break in upon the Companys Priviledges, That Provision be
made that no Cedula which may or cau affect the Comp: be sfued
out untill a draft or Copy has been first delivered to his Brtanick
Majestys Minister and to the Companys Agent at Madied, and
Safficient time allowed for Opposing the same if they see Just
cause
