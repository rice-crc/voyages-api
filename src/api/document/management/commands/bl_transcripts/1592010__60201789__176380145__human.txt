they remain in Y.^r Castles before a ship arrives to carry
them to the West Indies & especially if you ran a [Bayhead]

along with it, will be prevented from running into
the Sea, but subsiding to the bottom, near the Dam=
=head, when the water afterward by the [Sluices] is let

promine our selves from it, I am told that in the Country
of John Cabess, all about[Commenda] & up the River [there much]
much Gold hath formal been found, & therefor as John
Cabess is a Friend to the English, Tis to be hoped he may
be engaged by treaty & proper method Viz (of presents)
to Suffer You to try up & down his Country to Search for Mines
or to wait for Gold Dust, & to see what the land of
that River is capable of being made to produce &
this I desire you'l earnesly endeavour, to bring about as
being a Matter, which should it succeed will redound
infinity to yours & the Complaints Hon.^r & Benefit,
