The Comittee Settled a Letter to Mr Woolley at the Havana in
pursuance of the Resolution of the Court of the 14th Ultimo
transmitting him the accusations laid against him and
requiring his Answers thereto
Also settled a Letter to him in answer to his of the
16 Novr last and that which accompanied it
And order'd that they be Copied fair and laid before the
Great Court
It is the opinion of this Comittee that a Letter be wrote to
Sir Thomas Geraldino representing to him that the order
lately given by his Catholick Majesty not to admit the
Companys Ships at the Havana with less than to Negroes
to every 100 Tons is in several respects prejudicial to the
Companys Interest particularly at present there being
large Effects in Fruits at said place which will require
a great quantity of Tonage to bring home, and the demand
for Negroes at the same time not sufficient to answer the
number requisite to be introduced according to the sd Order
therefore desiring Sir Thomas to write to the Governor
of the Havana that for the present no obstruction may be
given to the admittance of Ships which shall be dispatch'd
by the Agents at Jamaica with Passes under the Companys
Seal, mentioning the Ships name and the number of Negroes
the Carrys, as also the Quantity of Provisions
Order'd That a Letter be wrote to his Exr Mr Keene
hereupon desiring he will apply to his Catholick Majesty
for a reversal of the said Order
Order'd That in the said Letter to sir Thomas Geraldino, he
be acquainted that Mr Keene is wrote to to make the applicatn aforesaid
