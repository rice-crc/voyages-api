I have a very hire value. before I had Notice of your
Inclinations to offer y.^r service for the County, Sir
Rich.^d Fowler had acquainted me with his desire
of continuing in the enjoym.^t of that How, & as
I never heard of any [crossed out] objection being made
to him in the discharge of his trust, it is not

to be wondred, if I gave him encouragement to
believe He might expect my trustful on that

Occation; however as I purpose to be down this
summer in Rednessh: there will be an Opportunity
of discouning, this Matter with you & the rest of
the Gentlemen, & I shall think my self very happy
If I can be instrumentall in accomodating it to y^e
Satisfaction of the County in Generall & Your self
in Particular to whom. I am.

I send you enclosed a Letter to Mr. Gugune,
which I desire you'l dispatch the Groom with over
to him as soon as it come, to hand.
I [write] you long since that I was willing to give
Barrell a Present of five Guinea (the Sum you
Indged reasonable) for his service to me last year
& accordingly You'l pay it & place it in y.^r next
Aud.

I make no doubt but you have heard of the
Vote part against L.^d [Coninsly] in the H: of Lord
& his being sent to the tower. I am apt to think it
Â will be no displeasing News to Herefore &C:.
