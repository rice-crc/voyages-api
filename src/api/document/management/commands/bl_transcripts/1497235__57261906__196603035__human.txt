even the Prince Frederick and its Effects; As to Mr Patino's Assu
rance that in Pere the former Orders have been Executed without
Restriction Wedont conceive how that can be We having had
no Factors or Agents there on the part of the Comps to receive any
of the Embargud Effects, nor have we heard of any disposition in
the Spaniards that way, on the contrary you are Tensible hor
at Havane as wells as in new Spain our Effects are avowed by
detained on pretence that the former Orders extend only to the T
Frederick and its Cargo, We are impatiently expecting the Ceda
for the Buenos Ayres Store Ship, which youll forward to us by
the first post after your obtaining it uenless you shall send it by
a Messenger that you judge will be here sooner, tho the best way
would be to send the orginal by one Conveyance & aduplicate
of you can procuce one) by another
We take it for granted that among the Cedulas you are in
Expectation of that to for our Annual Ship to follow the Flota will be
One, which if you have not yet demanded We desire youll lose no time
in procuring, having had such assurances given res of protection to
our future Comerce as incline us to be more forward in prosecuting
the same than We have of late been We suppose that the provid
for our sending the Goods into the Ireland Countrys must be
done by Cdula Separate and Distinct from that for the Annual
Ships going as was done in the year 1721, and to be general for
all our Annual Ships for the future whether bound for Cartagena
and Portobels or New Spain, And as to the Provision in relation
to the Alcavalas, Yourself will best Judge whether to ensort it
in the Intermnation Cedula or some special one for that purpose
As it is now the generally received opinion, that all
matters are adjusted between the Allies of Hanover and Spain,
particularly with regard to England, We conceive it the most
favourable opportunity to Obtain the redress of every material
Grivance attending us, and as by this agreement the old preju
Pdices entertained by Spain against this Nation are probable
healed, We cannot but hope the new Friendship will be lasting
