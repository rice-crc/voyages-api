Sir,
I reced [received] the favour of Yours relating
to the Scheme for the new Engraftment on the Affr: (affair) Comp (?)
to which I can only Answer, I did not concern my self in any
Part of this Affair more than as a Single Adventurer
and as such as long as I have the Honourable to be so I shall
do my utmost to promote the good of the Comp: (?) but for
what relates to the Subscriptions, or to any of the Court
of Assistants, disqualifing themselves, do not intend to
meddle or make with it, and doubt not but that they who
are the Directors will put it upon such a Tool as  will
be most likely to turn the Benefit of the Society. I take
the Liberty at the same time to Assure You that I have
always had a just Value for your Capacity, and on any
Occasion that offers shall very readily approve my seff
Your &.

Sir,
I return you my humble thanks for the Hous. [House?]
of yours, and the trouble you have given your self about
the Lucern seed; the Demand for it from England is so
large that I wonder it is difficult to get the Quantity I
desir'd, if any Arrives before August it will come time
enough to sow, and the harder it is to get the greater is the
Your &e
favour to Sir

M^r Hunt
