the Clamp of Brick, He need not have plac'd for
My Permission to have done this, since I hope he
makes no question but he command a greater matter
than this from me whenever he pleases.
I am oblidged to you for the concern you show
Counterpart of the Lease of the Wartland to
M.^r Vaughan, & as I think to be down in Hereford
for My Interest in putting me in mind of the
shire by the middle of next month, I'l take
care to have all the papers in my father's Clesell
inspected, that you may have such as are proper
for you to keep, & the like answers I must give
to what relates to the Widow of M.^r [Newton], in
the mean time you may forbid her cutting any
more wood, & if she claims a right from her
Lease to do so the must produce the Lease
& let you see her power. You are certainly very
right in y.^r Judgm.^t of the two offers made you

for Gahlers 3^E 10^str p Ann. & I shall encline to take
the latter, who offers the greater yearly Rent;
but then will not this prejudice the other part of
the farm, the Benhills, w.^ch I should hope may be
likewise improv'd and set for a better Rent, but as
it lies I think near Wilton, I would have it set
with a [Province] that in Case. I build a family
Seat at Wilton the Lease to be rid. I Give You
many thanks fo the Hint you give me of the
Guit Mill by the side of the Castle wall &
desire you to enquire what I may buy it for. I am
Y.^r affectionate Friend &c
