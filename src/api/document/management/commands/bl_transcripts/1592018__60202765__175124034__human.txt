Mr. Drummond
Dr. Sir
By the favour of yr. of the 5th & 8th Inst. I find
matters in France are very far from being like to be
Settle & amidst the variety of New Arrests & projects
wch every day are publisht it is hardly possible to make
any guess what course will be best for the parties
concernd to take for my own part as I have all along
left the care of what relates to my affairs to you, I must
continue to do so & assure you I have always been and
remain fully satisfied with ye fiendship, being
perswaded what you have done has been to the best of your
knowledge & judgmenti The misfortunes which have
happed was no more in the power of any man to have
foreseen than it was without Such fore knowledge to have
prevented them. I therefore desire you will continue ye
care & do just as you shall think best for
P. &c

very narrow Escape, & I hope he will, as he hath great reason
to be always thank full to that Providence which presend
him
