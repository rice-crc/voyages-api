I am much concern'd I cannot under-
=take to serve you in getting you into the next South
Sea subscription, I know very few of y^r Directors
& have little Interest w^th any of the Managers:
an Influence of w^ch I felt in the last Subpcripion
taken at 400 where I cou'd not get in 100^th for my
self. If it was in my power No Body shl^d be
more ready than my self to receive y^e Comands
& all y^e. I can do in this is to give in y^e[the] Names
for the Sum you desire to One of the Directors w^ch
I'll do, but cannot answer for the success.
I am Sir & etc

I sh.^d esteem it a great Happyness
to be serviceable to y^e Lady in y^e[the] subt. you desire
to have in the next Engraftmt. to y^e African Co., if any
such was intended: but I am persuaded there are no
thoughts of taking any such Course, nor do I believe there
is any one who is conversant in y^e Nature of this Trade
but why thinks the Capital is already too large: I
am sorry therefore it is not in my power to show on
this
