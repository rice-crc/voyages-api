My Lord
M^r. Gardner hath deliv.^d me the Lre
y^r. Grace did me the Honr. to write & is to be
with me again the beginnin, of next week upon
the subject of it he seems to be a gent.^m of good
sence & understanding & he experience in the
african trade may make him acquaint'd very
probally with several matters capable of being
render'd advantageous to the Company whatever
Success this meets with, they are however very
[Sensibly]  [touchy] with y^r. Graces Goodness to them &
hopes in the carrying on of this trade (in which
I am persuaded the Managers have nothing so much
of heart as to render it a National Benefit) to
behave themselves worthy of the continuance of
y^r. Graces protection : for my own part. I shall -
alwais esteem the enjoyment of it as the greatest
good fortune which can befall me now can y^r.
Grace bestow it upon One, who is more sincerely
& with greater Respect
My Lord [?]
