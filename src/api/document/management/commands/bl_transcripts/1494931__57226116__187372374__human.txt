Restrictions before Mentioned) without Our Special directions, and Expect for
the future, You will watch all opportunity of putting in Execution the Power
You have of Seizing, To which and we are sensible Our Agents at Jamaica will as

13. We Observe Your Compliants in former Letters of not being duly
Supplyed with Negrois. This in all probablity proceeds from Your over
Nicety in them, which is a Case We have experienced at Porto belo, And has

as they might otherwise have been, and has been a very Great Encouragement to
the private Traders, who find no Difficulty of Furnishing themselves at Jamaica

with the help of Your Seizures they would be beat out of that Trade, And as
We should then be the Sole Importers in Deed as well as in Name, you'd Soon
be able to advance the Prices, and at the same Time never want a quick

15 Days is a long Time for such a purpose But this We leave to you
to do as You find most for Our Interest.

Our Licenses for supply of the Windward Coast where We have no Factory.
