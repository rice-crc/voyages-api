us of Mr Bermudas, but We think neither he or the Tuntas, can
expect the recomencement of their Appointments, till we are in a
yof having a full Restitution and currenoy of the Assiento, by a
removal of the Cedulas that stand in its way; and especially whilst
our sloop & other Effects brought to old Spain remain unrestored
tho the not knowing what had been done in the Indies in vertue of
the orders of Reprisalia, which you wrote us in July last, was the
pretence then made use of for not delivering them up, cannot now
be supposed to subsist, when there things aredone or put into a
certain disposition of being so, We shall not be backward on our
part to consider those Gentlemen, and especially Mr Bermudas,
to whom you may give the Assurance of our particular regard for
him, as soon as a better Settlement of our Affairs will givens leave
We have received the Inventory you sent Us of the
particulars of the Acctos & papers delivered over to you by Mr Stratford
among which we observe are seven Copy Books of Letters writ by
him to the Company, but we don't find any mention made of the
mpanys Letters to him, which he ought also to deliver over to you
they being of use to inform you of the State of most of our dependencys
at Madred, & containing directions how to proceed, You will therefore
get the same from him having recourse thereto on all Occasions
He should also give you a List of what Autos have been
given into any of the Offices for your having recourse thereto
when the respective matters they pertain to shall come under Considera
tion, of which when you have it you will transmit us Copy
