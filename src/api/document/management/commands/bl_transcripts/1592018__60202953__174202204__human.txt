You express your Acceptance of my [Gratidutade]
far exceed the Value of the Mark I have
given of it for I may reasonable hope posterity
will think favourable of a Person to whom
You pay such Regard.

been Represented to me that you wanted only a
Proffesor in [Rhetoric]: Your letter as a mak
convincing Prof that [Art] wants no convenience
with you & I readily consent you should follow your
own Method of making such provision for the [Branim]

the less concern^d, that I mention My Opinion to
You because by changing, it, I have the opportunity
of Showing the reference I pay to Yours; & my Intentions
will be best  I answerd by Your oblidging some worthy
Member already renting among you. I shall conclude
Sir My thanks for Your Good Wishes & assurances
of the great Esteem of yr. Learn'd body & the
Readiness with which I shall embrace all future
