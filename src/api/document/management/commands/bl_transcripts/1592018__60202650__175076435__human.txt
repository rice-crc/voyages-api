of the unidee of his Mony I am as impatient
to be in posession of the Estate
As to Mr Wallon Estate, I take it to be as
Col. Danjy said that I aim to have the Rese
from Mdriin last, but I'll order Mr. Peter, who
hath the writings to Seld[?] you a certain Account
of it. I approve very well of what you propose
concerning quite pulling down the old House &
building a new Farm House with a Small Barn
I presume the Expence[Expense] cannot is owed very high
& by this means, & ordery[?] the Small Tenement to
it, as fast of the Lives drop, I may come
ins time to make a good farm of it, accordingly
I Shall be glad to see the Estimate and
Design of the Building. 
I will discourse My Coz: Philipcoft upon the
Estate call'd King but upon the Acc^t you gave
or of it After I had laid aside all further
thoughts of it
I am glad to hear you have made
So large a delivery of Cordwood to M^r. 
what Quantity more do you believe Menintor
Wood will yield & at what rate did you agree
the Cord for,  for I have forgot my self.
I leave the affair of M^r ??? to you to do
part as you will but if upon he hath he hath
been to many years a Tenant to the family, however
be better I should think to bring him to some
Comparition rather than give him much trouble
whatever of this you can bring him to, I make you a
present of.
