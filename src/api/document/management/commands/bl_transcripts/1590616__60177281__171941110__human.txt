Proposals for the Roal Assiento Company's carrying on a Trade to the
Windward Coast of the north seas of America
That Tract of Land which generally goes by the name of the Coast
of Caracas, or the Windward Coast of the north seas of America, lyes from
Santta Martta in the West, to La Guayra in the East, In all which Coast
The South Sea Company have never as yet thought fit to settle any
Factory Which I take to be owing to then having had the nature
of the trade to that Coast misrepresented to them, from whence they have
concluded it of no advantage to the company, but by what follows they
will plainly see, that 'tis not only beneficial, but one of the most consider
able Branches of their Trade to America
The cheif, (and which seems to me to have been the only) objection
is, That 'tis not a place capable to take off any considerable number
of negro slaves to contravale the charges of settling and maintaining
a Factory From what reason this is asserted I can't tell but to me
it seems an absurdity to think that a Tract of Land that has so
many Citys Towns and Inhabitants and make such vast quantity
of Cocoa, Tobacco, Tallow, Hides and Stockfishwood, together with the
Breeding of such great numbers of Mules (as it certainly does) should
be suppsd not capable of taking off a great number of Negroes
(by whose labour all those things are produced) For if it may be
Inferrd from the Trade there is to one port from Jamaica (And that
one of the most inconsiderable ones on the whole Coast) what may
be done with the whole? I should rather beliive it capable to take
off an equal number with most of the other Port in America
Especially If we consider the conveniency there will be for ye Inland
Merchants of Peru, who are obligd to go to Cartagena or Buenos Ayres
when they want negroes, which is a Long Voyage, and is very trouble
some and Expensive and consequently often hinders them from
going to Buy them, because of the Fatigue of the Journey
The Port I mean is Rio de la Hacha, (which is a small Town about
Thirty Leags to Windward of Santta Martta, and is Govern'd by a
Thimentle or Deputy to the Governour of that Place), to which place
are sent yearly Fifteen or Twenty Sloops from Jamaica with Negros
and dry Gords which are disposed of for mony, mules, Tallow, Hides
and Stockfishwood, each of which Sloops seldom carry less than Ten or
Fifteen Negroes which of it self make a pretty handsome number
for that one Port
Maracaybo takes off a great many every year, which are
imported by the Dutch Interloper, and Sloops from the windward
Islands and Jamaica In Return of which they have money, Cocoa
Tallow Hides, Tobacco and Stoekfishwood
Caracas is supplyd after the same manner. For the Dutch
have a sort of settlement at a place calld Tucacca, where they have
Store Houses Built and a very commodious Harbour for careening
their Vessels, &c
There are several other Places that take off a great many
Negroes every year as Cora, Aricola and Las Salinas, all which are
Supplyd in the same manner as above
As to the Advantage that is to be made by the Introduction
of Negroes on that coast, and from thence with the fruits of the country to
other Places in the West Indies as to Lavera Cruz with Cocoa, and to Jamaica
with Mules, Tallow and Stockfishwood, together with Buying up Hides and
Tobacco
