Messrs Brown Cox and Hilton being attending were
calld in and further Examind concerning the 2 Articles
of their accounts which this Comittee reported upon on the
30 Septemr last Vizt &
About the Charge for Maintenance of their White Servants
and Negroes
and about some Wine and Provisions
And the Comittee having fully consider'd thereof are of
Opinion that the Charges made by Mr Brown & Co late
Factors at Buenos Ayres of 4 Rials p diem for the
Maintenance of each of their White Servants, and of 1/2
Rial p diem for the maintenance of each of the Negroes
is unreasonable, But the said Partys not having been
restraind by their Covenants, and they declaring that they
Did really and bonafide disburse the above mention &
Expences which they have Charged the Company with,
and the Comittee having made further Enquiry, are
therefore of opinion That the said Expence of 1/2 Ryal
P Negro P diem may be allow'd if the Court approve
thereof notwithstanding that is the most that could be
disbur'd
And with regard to the 19 White Servants this Comittee
are of opinion that 22 Rials each p diem is sufficient to be
allow'd for the maintenance of them
