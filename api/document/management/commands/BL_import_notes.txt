Rules

make a column named "skip" and flag goofy entries to ignore them
clear out rows that seem to be sitting between separate docs
merge some data into the title colum, such as in 25563, where there's details on some of the letters
maybe try to split some blocks like on 25561, where we see numerous notes within a block like "same date as previous entry, but different entry"

If there is a column like "VID" then we want to tag that voyage when we create the source!! -- see MS 25575

**** Apparently no good transcriptions on:

SSC Add MS 25499
SSC Add MS 25557
SSC Add MS 25558
SSC Add MS 25559
SSC Add MS 25560
SSC Add MS 25561
SSC Add MS 25562
SSC Add MS 25563
SSC Add MS 25564
SSC Add MS 25565



**** 25560 HAD THE HEADER NOTE: "Henry Kelsall, Under-Secretary to the Treasury: 
Letters to, from the South Sea Company: 1721-1730."

**** 25555 HAD THE HEADER NOTE: "The following appear to be letters sent & received by South Sea Co."

**** 25449 AND 25495 HAD A BUNCH OF EXTRA ITEMS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SHEET THAT APPEAR TO BE BACKMATTER -- BUT WEREN'T GIVEN PAGE NUMERS. THESE WERE CUT FROM THE IMPORT.

**** 25550 HAS THE HEADER:  All following pertain to Committee of Correspondence

**** 25545 HAS THE HEADER, A LITTLE WAYS IN?: "All following meetings pertain to dividends annuities and balances of South Sea Company"


get filenames from 
* "add" + csv filename + fse??? + 3-digit version of numeric portion of pagenumber + recto or verso + '.jpg'
* like "add_ms_25570_fse004r.jpg"
* ... and how do i make the iiif image urls? what's that pattern?

create page images first
and get their transcripts from transkribus

run through it again.
break every time you hit an empty row
get item title from: date, type.
create a zotero item on that basis
create the SOURCE object -- and consider folding in all the entries in the notes col, for that doc, concatenated?

link it to the page images in that block of lines
