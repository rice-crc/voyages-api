President or Chief of our Panama and Portobello Factory, and Mr
Henry Johnson who We have also appointed to be our other Factor

other of the Royal Officers there, who upon the late seizure of the
Concerns, would not permit it to be broke, as the other was at Panama
We therefore entreat your Excellency to direct, That that old Mark
may be forthwith deliver'd up to our present Factors, lest by any accident
it fall into any private hands, and an ill use Should be made of it to the
prejudice of his C.M. and the Company
We pray God to preserve you many years in all health an
prosperity bing with great Respect
