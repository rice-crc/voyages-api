Messrs Rigby & Pratter
The Companys Ship Royal George in her late voyage
from Jamaica to England, being put back to Antigua, and there
condemnd as incapable of being repaird and coming to England, and
there being other accounts, which make it doubtfull whether She
was in so bad a condition, as to deserve a condimnation; We have
sent out M Bird and Mr Hill two Skilful Shipwrights, with 20
other Shipwrights, and falkers for the purpose of repairing her, in
lase she be found capable of it, And have directed them, if they do
proceed to repair her, and her Sails Rigging and other Stores should
have been sent to Jamaica, as it is probable they may have been
for the sake of Selling or disposing of them to the best advantage
that they apply to you for them: You will therefore deliver such of
them as you may have by you And if they should be in the hands of
any other persons in your Island to use your endeavours to procu
them, by purchase or otherwise in the best manner Gouean, you
will also supply them with what other Stores they may want for
the use of the Royl George, for Navigating her home We are
Your Affectionate Friends
