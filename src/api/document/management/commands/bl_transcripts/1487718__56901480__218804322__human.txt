of the Capt. that sold the Negroes, to prove the Fact of the Negroes
bought on the Coast, But in as much as the said Capt. cannot
prove the Fact of Johnsons Sharing in the after proffit and as the
present Report has immediate Relation to his Conduct only, The
Comittee think it needless to wait the Arrival of the said Evidence
and Submit it as they have done before, whether even supposing the
Fact to be tue, whether it does not admitt of an Apology and Excuse
or at least whether it be so unpardonable a Crime, as that he should
be accounted uncapable of the Companys Service. If he in the
present Juncture of Affairs, may be of good use abroad.
Upon the whole the Comittee cannot but Observe, upon
the Evidences before them, That the Declaration of the two free Negroes
is very loose if any Credit were to be given to it, That as it is not
on Oath, the Credit of Mr Hutchinson who is disinterested in the
Matter must be accounted Superior, who declares it impossible to
betrue, That Negroes cannot be Introduced and Markt Clandestinly
in or near Guayabal without publick knowledge of it.
That the Declaration of Harwood Carrys but little Celdit
unless it were supported with other Evident Proof; Not because he
has twice changed his Religion to that of a Roman Catholick having
first done it at Cuba for a By purpose afterwards for his Interest
appeard as a Protestant in the Factory of Portobelo and Panama
and since become a Roman Catholick again and is fled to Lima after
Darrock, But because he has a general Bad Character, as a Man that
will say or do any thing for his Interest, and this is Confirned to the
Comittee by Mr Hutchinson; and the Comittee have the Evidence
of his the said Harwoods Character out of his own Mouth, by the
Narrative in 1724 Against Denniss Swartz and Johnson, and the
Letter to Johnson in 1227 wherein he says Case Methods have been taken to
ruin his Caracter; If any Credit is to be given to the first Narrative, as
much is due to the Subsequent Letter to Johnson, and perhaps more,
as it is Confirnd in some degree by the Letter of the Provider to Swartz
Read in Court the 9 Aug. 1728
