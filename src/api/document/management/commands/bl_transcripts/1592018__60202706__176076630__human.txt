Dear Sir
You may w.^th great Reason wonder at
my long silence, after having rec.^d y^e fav.^r of so many
of your Letters, but to confess ingenuorusly, People's
Thoughts have been so much employ'd about our
growing Mississippi here, that they have had no
leisure to think of yours in France. South Sea was
this day sold at 310: I hear it is fallen something
since, but I make no question but it will rise to 400
& upwards, when the Bill depending is past.
I rec.^d y^e acco.^t you were pleas'd to send me
w^ch I find to be very just, & hope a little Time more
will let me see, I was not in the wrong to lay my Mony [Money]
out in that Stock, I am sure I was much in y^e right
to put it into your Managem.^t I observe you have
not bro.^t into the acco.^t y^e â‚¤500 I desired your acceptance
of, as a small acknowledgem.^t of my Thankfullness for y^e
Friend.^p you gave me lately so Obliging an subtance of,
in y^e happy Settlem.^t you have bro.^t about for my
Relation, but I must desire you'l either debut it in
y^e next or let me remit it over to you.
I have heard nothing yet of y^e Phaeton,
but hope it will be over before Summer w^ch now begins
to come on apace. The Silk for my Wife is come over
it is very fine, & she returns her humble Thanks for
the Trouble you have so obligingly taken. I live in
hopes that tho the Bureau you intended me is gone
another as good will come, & blush when I think what
Commissions I take the Liberty to send you at the same
Time that I know how many others you have of too great
