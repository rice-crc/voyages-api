D. Friend.
I rec.^d yours & have much to M^r. Lake to
desire him to compound for as little as he can the
Debts of those pass people He & you sent me
the Lists of what can be sav'd of their Debts
to their Cred.^t I am willing to give to them them-
=selves to enable them to set up & try & get as
[harest] livelyhood with.
The partcular of Piercefield Estate I can lay
nothing to, till I knew that is ask't for it, & where
you are [insained] hereof, you'l oblidge me to acquaint
me with it.
I shall very readily employ the Persons (M^r.
Back) whom you recomended to me for Dep.^t Steward
if I hold the Stewardship, w.^ch I cannot determine
upon, till I see how L.^d [Conesry] cause goes
concening the Jurydiction He claims, for tho
I should readily Serve the City of [Learners]
in that Capacity, I cannot think of Submitting
to be his [Bailif] which I must be if I  hold this
Port, & he succeeds in his claim.
He hath very [inrulently] as perused the [High]
Sheriff in his Petition to the King, if it is
refer'd to the attorney Gen^.l & Solliciter Gen^.l to
examine the facts, & report their Opinion, it was
heard before them last Saturday, but nothing done
upon it, as lands past off to a further hearing it
there were Affidavits made of M^r. Wilkentones
affection to the govenuo^r & sent up to his Councill
to lay before the attorney  ^& still  [crossed out] I'would be of service
