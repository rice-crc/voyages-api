so long as the Company shall Enjoy it, And should any temptations
that may be offerd, Induce the Company to part with that priviledge
hereafter the Comittee think this Factory should be laid aside Since
the Negroes alone cannot bear such Expence.
The Comission to be Allowd the Factor in leu of Salary may
if the Court think proper be the same as at Carthagena, which will
be pretty Equal to their present Salarys
The Comittee are very Sensible, that in Regard to the Comps
Interest it is the same thing where the Expence is laid Whether
wholy or partially on the Negroes or Annual Ship, but as the
Expence is unavoidable, unless there be no Factory, and other means
are found to supply that Country with Negroes, the Comittee think
it not Improper to Apportion it in the manner proposd. All
which is Submitted
