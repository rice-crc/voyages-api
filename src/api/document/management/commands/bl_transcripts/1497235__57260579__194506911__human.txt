Mem. The letters to Gravesend & deal touching the ship City of London
are entred in the home letterbook pages 22:23:24:25
Sr, I have ben favour d with your particular tre tone of
the 14 August, and those to Mr Rudge & myself of the 18:20 & 21
are also receivd The latter enclosing Copy of your Memorial to the
Plemipos, which I think well drawn and Enfored, and shews a proper
Geal and Readnes on the Companys part to Act both Offensively and
defensively Icant imagune why Mr Stanhope desires so Explicit
in Answer whether the Company's Affairs Should all be brought on
before the Congress, when We have all along implicitly left the Conduct
of that Matter to his prudence and better Judgement. He told me before
his Departure that in his Opinion all Afairs of Accounts & dispute
would be best settled by Comissarys and that the Business at the
Congress would be Chiefly to sittle matters for the future, In which
I agreed with him because otherwise it seem'd to me that the Congress
might be held to an Unreasonable Length. But still I think We
Should know our whole Charge during the Congress and draw up our
defence as well as make our Complaints and demand redress pen
Dding the Congress, that the same may by Common Consent of party
sand referred to the Decision of Comissarys, Otherwise disputes may
hereafter
