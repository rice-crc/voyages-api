D^r Sir
Yours of the 1: Just. MS:. is come
Safe to Hand together with the account it
enclos'd of, what hath been transacted in
ye West. the Fall of that stock will prove
I fear as ruinous to many who were con-
-cernd in it, as our South Sea hath been
have, I find upon the Ballance I am
indebted to you in the sum of £168030.
which I hope in try or, three monthy to
ay
be able by the rise of stocks here to discharge
[lenis?] you are so oblidging to leave to me or
fix the time for the payment of the
borrow'd
$200000: & of the 10^ Guinea, I ^borrow'd
of you, I would desire it may be at 
Midsum. next by which time our Parl [Parliament]
will have been adjournd or prorogued long
enough for the stocks to have felt the
Benefit of their Resolutions, w^ch will by
that time be got up as high as Orecan
expect & consequently twill le a proper
time to take the Advantage of their
rise by Selling out, as on the Contrary
if they are not pretty high by  Midsummer.
It will be in vain to expect they should get
up much afterward, & twill then be us 
well for me to sell out at that as at any
other time. Your wen so kind in Ye formen
letter to tell me I might draw upon Mr.
