South Sea House 24th Aug 1727
Mr. Stratford
Sir,
Since the Court wrote you the 80th March they have dee
received Yor up to the 11th Just And as You have recover'd your Libert
they think it unnecessary to send you the Certificate You desired in
relation to the accot & the Juntas Salarys; and indeed any fertifie
of that Nature scoms to be a needless formality seing the Courts Letter
out of wch You might have given Extracts) ought to have been of
sufficient Credit for that purpose
They have read the Letters wch passd between the Dutch
Embas & the Marg de Par upon the Subject of the Ship T. Frderick
to thank the Dutch Ambassador & the Comp other Ships & offects in the West Judies, and are very me
pleased with the Zeal & Judgement with which the former has
distinguishd himself on that Occasion, They would have you wait
on his Exy & return him their thanks
As to Your Solliciting a Cedula for further Asinual
Ships to go this Year, the Compt heave no Notion of sending our
more, till they are secured of bringing home those they have a lread
in the Judies, neither do they judge it advisable to stir in it till then
Just now is come to hand Yor Letter of the 18th Just
The Comp were in hopes You would have given them some Accot
the Dutch Ambast Success in the Restitution Affair, seing yor ltle
of the 11th mentions that he was to carry the next day the form of a
Order for that purpose to the palace, but in this last they take Note
You have not pursued that thread, saying only that You had found
Copy of an Order for the Restitution in the Year 1721 wc You thong
was deficient of wch you had acquainted Mr Bermuder, but You
have not in this Letter explaind or even hinted wherein that Defe
consisted. This has lead me to read over that Ceda And Idont
conceive but that it was well done, & conformable to the Treatyo
Peace upon wch twas gounded; And I dont recollect that I ever
heard
