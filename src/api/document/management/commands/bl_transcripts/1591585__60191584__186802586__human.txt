Worthy Sir
Caracas May ye 22d 1740
Stake the freedom to Trouble You with the enclosed
which contains my Will, and therefore I have wrote upon
it to be opend on my Death, Tho' I hope I shall have the
Honl of seeing you before that Time comes, as at present
I hade my Healm very well.
What has occasion'd me the giving you this Tronble
is the Experience I have already had of your Frendships
since the Death, of my good Frenid Sr Richd. Hophins, who
during his Life gave me leave to appoint him one of

my Executors, And as you succeed him in Your
Freindship to me, so I have made bold to hommate
you in the enclosed Will, and hope you will not be
displeased at it. As to my small Estate, in Case of
my Decease it will occasion very little Trouble, As
it is in South Sea Annuitys, Trading Stock (if bought)
and 3 P Cent Annuitys payable at the Bank, unless my
Wife may have any India Bonds by Her, I beg
pardon for this presumption and am with the
Greaters Regect
Your most Olliged & Obedt. Humble Servt.
