South Sea House London 14 Nov. 1728
Sir, The last I wrote you by order of the Directors was
of the 7 Instant, Inclosing Copy of what I wrote that day to M
Delafaye, in relation to your demanding of the Court of Spain, a
general Circular Cedula for the Restitution, and reestablishment
of the Companys Commerce. I now by their Order send you inclosed
Extracts of Lotters which they have reced by the Solebay Man of
War from their Supra Cargoes and Factors at La Vera Crux and
Havana, by which and also by the Inclosd Translation of the
Proceedings in Nen Spain upon the Vice Roys Receipt of the Orders
for Restitution t you will perceive the Apprehension they formerly
wrote you they were under of the Insufficiency of those Orders was
too well grounded, those Orders being construed to Extend only to the Prince
Frederick, its Cargo, and the two Sloops at Vera Cruz, and should the
like obstruction obtain with the Vice King of Perue, then no Provision
at all is understood by him to be made by the Orders Sent for restoring
any other of the Companys Effects at their Several Factorys; This been
of great Consequence to the Company, They have this day laid a
Memorial Thereupon before the Duke of Newcastle, praying his
Grace to Transmitt you Instructions for your demanding of the Court
of Spain the general Circular Cedula and Duplicates already recom
ended to you; The draft or form of which Cedula the Comittee havin
upon receipt of the aforesaid Letters, Revised, they have thought
proper to make Some Alterations therein as you will see by the
inclosd Copy to which I referr you, and presume you will soon
hear from his Grace thereupon, In the mean time you are desired
to Collect the Senfe of the Papers now Sent you, and to prepare from
thence aproper memorial to the Court of Spain, that no time may be
lost
The Men and Stores for the Prince Frederick, are now directed
to be forwarded with all possible Expedition from Jamaica to V:X
