The Court of Directors having Agreed in Opinion
with this Comittee, in Exhibiting Complaints in form against
Don Manuel de Alderote Pesident of Panama, and Don
Joseph de Audia Governour of St Martha, Judge it necessary
to observe further from the many hardships and unjust
Oppressions under which the Affairs of the Company as well
in old as New Spain, have hitherto Labourd, There Seems
to be a necessity of obtaining by Some means or other, Such a
Ready Zealous, and Friendly attention to the Complaints
of the Company from time to time at the Court of Madrid, as
may procure them Suitable Redress, in order to deterr Govr
and other officers in the Indies from the Repetition of the like
Injurys, to which they have been Encouraged by the Support
of their own Friends and Agents, who have been by Experience
found Superior to any Influence of the Company in the Ordinary
way of application. And for as much as it does not appear to
the Comittee that the Company have hither to reap'd any benefitt
from
