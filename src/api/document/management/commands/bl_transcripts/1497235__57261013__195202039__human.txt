at the Congress having discoursd those of Spain on this Topick, their Ansuel
was, That they were firmly perswaded that the Governors of the Ports only wait
Orders from the Vice Roys, and that upon the Receipt of them, there would not
be mnade the least Difficulty in Admitting our Factors, tho' We think it very
ill judged of them not to go themselves when they had so fair an Opportunity
by the man of War that carried the Orders, And tis not improbable that
the Diffidence they discover'd thereby might be one Cause of their Non
Admission, had they gone on Shoar and tender'd themselves to the Go
vernor at the same time the Orders were deliver'd to him, they would more
Certainly have known the Governors Objections, and how grounded, which
also would have been material for us to have been informd of They would
also then have had the Opportunity of Pootesting against the Governors
Conduct, as a breack of the Preliminarys, and of the Reciprocal Orders which
were founded thereupon, Which being matter of so great Consequence that
the Coming away of the Galleon seem'd to depend on the Spaniards
Executing the Orders on their part, might have indued the Governor to
have admitted them
Weare at a Lop to know what young Mr Bleckynden four late
Factors Brother) is doing, We understand He has a power or Deputation
from his Brother to recover the Company's Offects at Portobelo & Panamay
which weare no ways satisfied with, nor by any means can allow, And
therefore you will be very Natchfull of him, and not permit him to go over
if you can possibly prevent it, but if he be already gone, You are by any
Means that you lawfully may, to Stop and Intercept any Effects
that he shall send or bring over with him, even tho' he should insist
they were his own, or his Brothers, as under suspicion of their belonging
to the Company, The Method for doing which your Lawyers will best
adoise
Enclosd are our Lres to our Supra Cargoes & Factors at Demfour
which you will Cireffely frorward.
