London 3d April 1729
My Lord
Captain Charles Burnham upon his return to this Part
acquainted us that your Lordship had received our Letter Dated the 8th
of June 1726, and that your Lordship had allowed ye Cargo of Slaves
to be introduced to Buenos Ayres and (as he reports) to be sold in a
fair & publick manner the produce thereof he tells us was represaliated
till the publick Affairs betwixt Spain & Great Britain should be
Settled
He deliverd to us Don Matheo Goxenolas receipt for 283
Negroes & Don Francisco de Orbes Receipt for 6 more wch makes in all
289 Negroes deliverd for account of the Royal Asso. Compa by that Ship
He acquaints us that your Lordship had shown him all
the Civilitys that you possibly could
We heartily wish that your Lordship had been pleased
to favour us with an account how the foresaid Slaves had been
disposed of, the which would have enabled us to have set this Affair
in a Clear light in our Assiento Accounts. As We are every hour
expecting Capt Moor Whites Arrival, We are in hopes that such
Account relating to both these Ships Cargoes may thereby be trans-
mitted to us by your Lordship
Tho the Ireliminary Articles & orders for Re settling
our Assiento Trade have only been forwarded from Spain last December
by the Register Ships for Buenos Ayres to Your Lordship We nevertheless
less hope that the News thereof reached your place by other Conveyances
from Portugal or elsewhere, and that our Factors thereon enjoyed the
Several libertys granted by the Assiento Contract, and that our Effects
have been restored pursuant to the said Preliminarye
Under this Confidence We have entertaind in our
Service, the following Ships vizt the St Michael Capt Burnham
the Rudge Galley Capt Williams bound to Madagascar & Buenos
Ayres, and also the Ships Mermaid Capt Pearse and the Essex Capt
Pinkethman bound to Angola & Buenos Ayres to purchanse a sufficient
Number of Negroes for the Supply of that part of our Contract as
relates to your Jurisdiction
