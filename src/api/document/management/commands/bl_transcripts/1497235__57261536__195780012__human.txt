Sir
We have duly reced your Lotters up to the 30 March last,
with the Packetts and other Papers which came inclosd and observe you
had Executed his Majestys Orders, in presenting the Two Memorials to
the Court of Spain for the general Cedula of Restitution Liberty of
the usual Ports &c which we hope will meet with a quick and
favourable Issue, and as we are assured that the like limitted Con=
Struction which has been put in New Spain with regard to the
Restitution, has diffussed itself to the Havana, & probably to other places
where there are Assiento Effects, there feems to be no possibility of getting over
that difficulty, without this new Cedula Youill therefore puish it all you can
orging the great damages the Company has alread ye sustained by the loss of
time & c And on this occasion you will give us leave to remind you, That
by the 3d Article of the Treaty of Peace made between GBritain & Spain
Anno 1721, and by his CM Cedula wch was Issued in conformity thereto
there was special provision made that in case any of our Effects wch had been
Embargud in the Indies on the first Ruptura, should not remain in the
same Species at the time of Restitution, then the value wch such Effects
bore at the time of the Emtargment, was to be made good to the Company
as you will seety the enclose Extract of that Treaty & Copy of the Cedula
You will therefore Consider whether some provision like that is proper to
be made in the present Cedula, The Companys Effects now under Embargo,
consisting not only of Money but Ships Goods and Negroes, some part
of which have been disposed of by the Spanish Officers during by Suspension
and probably at fraudulent underprices, as was prackied upon te first
Reprisalia
We have looked into the letters we have receivd from
Mr Nicholson at the Havana, but they give usno further light
into the Affair of the Tobaceos made use of by the Spaniards, than
you are already appried of
We
