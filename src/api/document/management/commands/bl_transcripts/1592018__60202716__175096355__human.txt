Dear Sir
I have rec^d. both y^.r Fav.^or of y^e
3^d & 10^th Just & am much pleas^d w.^th y^e hopes
you give Me y^t. the Actions will rise in a little
time in France when they come to 2000 (unless
you see a manifest probability of their still going
higher) I shall be willing to dispose of  mine &
wait y^e Opportunity of a favourable Exch^a
to being over the Money, w^ch I believe before y^e
End of the year may probably come up to 50
if the [edits?] for the Altercation of the Species
I have rey^d y^e
continue their Force.
[Edits?] you were so kind to get for Me & desire
you'l continue to pick up y^e others that may still
come out on this Subject & of the same paper
w^th.  More seat over that when bound they may
the better stand of the same Shelf. I must
desire you'l send Me over the Map the French
have made of the Mississippi Country, I am told
there are two one more just than y^e other
however I sh^.d be glad of both. The Phaeton is
safe arrived & I return you many thanks for y^e
Trouble ab^t. it, but I have heard no News of y^e
Bureau or the PostChaise, w^ch [we] got ready
I w^.d beg may be also sent over. The Phaeton
is exceeding next & I think very well worth the
Money, the Curtains are out of Order, but I shall
easily got them mended, I presume they are made
only for a Park or large Garden, for were they
to be us^d in our Roads, they'd overturn alright
