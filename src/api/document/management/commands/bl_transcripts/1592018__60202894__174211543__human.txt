Yours of the 22.^d N.S. is come to hand.
but that w.^ch you Sent by the Express is not
yet arriv'd, & I wish some accident hath not
hapned to the Poen Fellow, & that He was not
sort in the storm about a Week ago at Sea.
I wonder my Letter of the 4th came not in
time to you for I generally send my Letters to
one of the officers in the general Port hours
who take care to put them safe into the Mail.
