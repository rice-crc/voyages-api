Sir
The Bearer hereof M^r. Borthnick will I hope
arrive in safety to Cape Coast to have the Hon^r
of delivering you thiy in Person. He is a Gentleman
I believe, you will find so dilligent & desirous to
improve himself in Business, this I shall sued
to say little to recomend him to your fav^r. being
Satisfied his own Capacity & application to the
good of the Service will suffciently do it, of it self
His Relations are Gentlemen of considerable figure
& will be very glad to have the pleasure of
seeing him thrive under your Protection for
w^ch purpose & trouble you with this Recomenda-
-ton in his behelf.
Since my Lett^r. by Cap^t. Barlow, in which
I wrote at large my thoughts concerning the
pobablity there is in discovering Gold Mines
from the vast quantity of Gold Dust, which
every flood washes down from the Neighbouring
hills, I have discours't with Several Gentlemen
concerning this Affair, & by what I have
learnt from M^r. Hages & M^r. Grevenen, I am
confirmn'd in my opinion that then must be
Mines & very rich ones even is the Companies
Garden about the stills: & therefore I have sent
into the proper parts of Enland to get a Ban
& an Overseer of Miners, from the Tin Mines, to
go over to Cape Coast to try what discoveries they
can make, the Company being willing to be at this
Expence. I choose to Send as the Tin Miners.
