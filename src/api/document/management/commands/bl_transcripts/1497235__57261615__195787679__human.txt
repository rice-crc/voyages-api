12 And whereas for your greater case and to save y expence
and delay in preparing Written Bills of Sale for the Negroes, We have
Settled a proper form of them to be used at all our Factorys, and
herewith deliver you one thousand printed ones wch proper Blanks
to be filled up by you, You are to observe the Tenor of them, and
accordingly express therein the Country Age and most distinguishable
Marks and Cutts on each Negro you dispose of the better to avoid
any other Negroes protection under your dispatches, and that
they be described in such manner as to render impractiable any
Fraud of that Nature, You are always to draw up two Bills
of Sale whether for one or more Negroes, the one to be sign'd by
you and deliverd to the Buyer, and the other to be sign'd by
the Buyer, and to remain with the Factory

not by the ps of India, And whereas We have been Informed
that it has sometimes been practised (ths not as We hear on the

Sale at a higher price for the sake of inhancing the price of
the Negroes upon Subsequent Sales, or for some other reasons
Wedo not think it consistent with the honour of the Company
to be party to any thing that looks like a Deception, and
considering besides that other inconveniencys may attend the
accounting for the Negroes so Sold, We therefore absolutely
forbid it
