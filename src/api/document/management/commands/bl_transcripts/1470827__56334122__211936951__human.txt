Captains General of Spain for putting in Execution the Artice
in the late Treaty for retoring all effects seized in Spain belonging
to the English
These are all the dispatches the Company are in Possession of
and the Committee observe that those for restoring the Companys Effects both
in New and Old Spain are but Copies the Originals of that for restoring the
Companys Effects in the Indies being to be sent as Mr Uzardi writes directly
from Spain
By which means it will lye in the Power of the Spanish Officers
especially those in the Indies to Conceal the said Dispatches, or Delay the
putting them in Exxecution, And therefore the Committee are of Opinion
tis absolutely Necessary that the Company should have the Orginals of
these Dispatches to be sent to the Several Factorys as soon as possible,
And that a letter to this purpose be prit to Mr Uzardi by next Thursdays
