There will be any; but if any such should hereafter
happen as I am ignorant of what share will be allotted
me for myself & friends, I must entreat you will not
take it amiss, if I decline making any promises of
giving subscriptions away before I know how far [Pwill] be
in my power to perform them. I am with great respect

June 28 1720
Sir
I have just rec^d. your kind letter, w^ch gives me fresh Instan=
=ces of your friends: from which I have always rec^d such - -
benefit. & send you enclos'd the two aftidavits I mention'd in
my last & desire you'l make what enquiry you can privately
into it not being willing to have any Noise made of it, which
might do Mr. Osmans character any prejudice or lessen him
amongst the Tenants: if the Affidavit made by Whatly is true,
He is certainly much to blame for turning out an old Tenant,
especialy when He was willing to have given double the Fine
which Jackman, whom He put in his room paid: tho^h as for
Selling the Copy it is what I am by no means encline to &
what I beleive you would not advise me to as for the Tenant
at the Mill, the pulling these down is what I was dispos'd to
of myself having always found them, wherever I have had
them to be a very expensive sort of Estates, however in con=
=sideration of the Present Tenants Age, & the length of time
he hath held them you may give him the comfort of assuring
him I will not pull them down during his Life, but he shall
enjoy them as long as He lives, w:^ch I hope will please & make
him easy.
I remember very well the Instance you mention
relating to the present intended my Coz: Brydges's Lady, but
thought she had been acquainted only with the first settlement
of the Irish Estate and did not know she was appriz'd of the latter
