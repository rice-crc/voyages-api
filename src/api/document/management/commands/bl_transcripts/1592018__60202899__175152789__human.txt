Hands, yet I would not have you agree, for any
without first acquainting me with the terms as
Stocks are fallen, I cannot afford to give above
2 or 23 years parchape for Any
I have heard nothing since from Mr. Wooly
Of James Owen Character is as you seem to
think it. I shall be as kind to him as any
Land Lord you see what right & the
Neighbour of them. Mr. Fletcher Powell
hath been with me about Several Matters
relating to the Estate I bought of him hee
gave him a general AnswerÂ  & told him that
so much other business I could not mind then
Matter & that as you had taken the Charge
of them. I left them to your care & Managem
I referred him to you to talk with You about
them.
The sooner I receive an answer concerning
Mr Grovenor tyths, the better in regard the
stays in town purely to finish & execute the
Conveyame.
I hope your Stay in Deebysh will not be
long for I am very impatient to have any concern
under your Care set upon a good foot, & pray
at the have the rental up a good as may be
o beleev there can be no difficulty about
Morlys House & doubt not but Mr. Bridgwate, &
Wight will take due care to be every thing
relating to the conveyancy true with all safely
& care, as will prepent any dispute from being
made never for upon it.
