without Molestation, and you must by all means Endeavour to
prevail it being the great and principal use of the Cedula We
propose, That it Confirm the Orders already sent by Satino for
restoring all the Company's Ships Vessels or Effects Embargud in
the Indies and for reestablishing the Assunts on the foundation of
the Treatys relative thereto, According to his Royal Will, and
Conformable to the Preliminary Articles, and the Act at the
Sardo
It is Requisite that you demand as soon as possible after this affit
is settled, the Customary Cedula for the Annual or permission Ships That in
Case of Refusal we may make Our Complaint at the Congress, which we
will not suppose they will give us Occasion for You are to observe that
this Shyp which by the Assints Treaty as but of 500 Tons, was by the
Subsequent Treaty of Convention, advanced to 650 Tons for 10 years
& a Recompence for the disapointment of sending Three Annual Ships
or 1500 Tons of Merchandize during the years 1714 1715 & 176 So
which the Company had not sent out any, Supposing that the Same
might and would in that time be made good, So that had not the
Company been prevented therein by the two Rupturge & for want
of his Cath Majesty's Cedulas for their due & regular proceeding
They would in the 10 years past which Expired Anno 1727, have
enjoyed the priviledge of 6500 Tons whereas in Truth they have sent
out no more than 5 Ships amounting to but half the Quantity The
oother half being Still dia to them, so that We may reasonably hope
the same Equity which Indued the King of Spain to add the 150 Tons
for 10 years to make amends for the former loss of 3 Annual Ship
will prevail now, and that the Cedula may be for a Ship of 650 Sons
for the following year Notwithstanding the Exprration of the Term it
was granted for which trust on the New face, publick affairs begin to
appear in, will not be deny'd.
Your own prudence will instruct you, that if on your
Application for the Cedula for the Annual Ship of 650 Tons, No
Exception is made to the Expiration of the 10 years and Consequent
Return to the 500 Sons Ship, It is no ways requisite that
you start it, what We have said thereto, being matter only
