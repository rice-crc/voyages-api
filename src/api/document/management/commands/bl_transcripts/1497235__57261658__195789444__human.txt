Preliminary Articles and other dispatches transmitted by the
Court of Spain to the several Governments in the Indies, our Ass:
and Cedulas are again in full Sorce and sufficient to enable you
to Seize and Confiscate as well what Negroes have been illicitly
Introduced during the Suspension as before and since and could
it be supposed ot herwise it would render impracticable all future
Seizures, it being difficult if not impossible to distinguish the
Negroes Introduced before or during the Suspension, from those
Introduced afterwards But should any difficultys arise in
relation hereto, that you cannot surmount even with the
Assistance of your Judge Conservator (whose power is very great
as appears by the 13th Article of the Assiento) or by any other
means you judge proper You are to Inform us thereof
fending us Authentick Testimonys, that We may ground
our demand thereupon for a particular Cedula for explaining
this point

great numbers of Negroes have been Introduced into the several
parts of the Spanish West Indies, and particularly on the Island
of Cuba thro' the encouragement given by the Spanish Governors
who have even gone so far as of their own pretended Authority to
Issue out Licenses for that purpose, and have also Indutted great
numbers of the Negroes so Introduced under powers or pretended powers
from the King of Spain You are to look upon those Introductions and
Indultos as illegal and unjust, and to get the best & most Authentick
Informations you can of them, the better to enable you to make Seizures
thereof, and tho you have power by the Assiento to Seze all Negroes
which have been Indulted by the Spanish Governors, it may not be
preident to proceed with that severity with respect to such Negroes,
However the least satisfactin We can have for the damages the Company
