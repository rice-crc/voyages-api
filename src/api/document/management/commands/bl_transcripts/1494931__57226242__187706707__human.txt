of their Maintenance to a Certainty to allow you 6d p headÂ  P diem from
the Time they shall be first received into yor possession to the Day of their
being Shipd off for any of the Factorys And as to any other incidental Clarges
we recomend it to you to be as good Husbands as possibly you can, And
if what we have already wrote you in regard to the Allowance of
Conveiencys for this purpose, be not sufficiently explicit We leave it
to you, who best know the Conveniencys you may want to supply
Your Selves, at the most reasonable Expence you can
For the more regularly Supplying our Selves with
Negroes in a continued Course We have settled a Scheme of what ships
to send out each Month (of wch inclosed is Copy) wch if we can effectualy
Execute (as we have reason to believe we can as well as others) may
make an ample Provision, and especially as we have put a stop to
the extreme Nicety of our Factors: This Scheme is drawn up as near
as we can form it, agreable to the Advices we have reed from Your
Selves and the Several Factorys But as you observe, the Scareity of
some particular Sort of Negroes renders it impracticable to procure
so many of those Sorts, as we would and that of what have been
furnished these two last years, there have been a major part of the
Casts which have been forbid and yet in the whole there has been a
deficency of above 1/3 to answer the Assiento, We are of opinion it
will be difficult if not impossible to supply it fully any other
Way than by Selling Merchantable Negroes of all Countrys for
the most that can be got, provided they answer in profit. You will
therefore if any Alteration Occurs to You, convenient to be made in
the Scheme advise us as soom as you can
