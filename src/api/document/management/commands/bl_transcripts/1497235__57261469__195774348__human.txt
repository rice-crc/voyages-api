We have thought it for His Catholick Majestys Service
as well as that of the Company to alter the former Negro Mark that at
Portobelo being as We are informed by our late Factors in the Custody
of some or other of the Royal officers there who upon the late Imbarg
ment of the Companys Concerns would not permit it to be broke as We
are assured the other was at Panama, We therefore Intreat your
to direct that that old marks may be forthwith delivered up to
our present Factors, lest by any Accident it fall into any private
hands and an ill use should be made of it to the prejudice of His
Catholick Majesty and the Company
We pray God to preserve you many years in
Health and Prosperity being with great Respect
